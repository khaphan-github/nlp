LA062390-0068,16,22,"The quake, which rocked the northern region of Iran early Thursday, left nearly 29,000 dead, by official count, and about 400,000 homeless."
LA062390-0068,17,13,"The death toll is expected to rise, however, as rescuers continue work ."
LA062390-0068,18,24,"Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations."
LA062390-0068,19,16,"Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid ."
LA062390-0068,20,42,"Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit international assistance ."
LA062390-0068,21,44,"The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians ."
LA062390-0068,22,20,Some Jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position because of Iran's hostility toward the United States and Israel.
LA062390-0068,23,22,"Confronted with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance ."
LA062390-0068,24,33,"Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims ."
LA062390-0068,25,24,"After a spirited discussion, the group decided to help but to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision ."
LA062390-0068,26,14,"""We're a humanitarian organization . . . without regard to political considerations,"" Griffel said."
LA062390-0068,27,14,"""But if they are going politicize it, we will definitely reconsider our participation"" ."
LA062390-0068,28,25,"Amir Zamani, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, welcomed the ""many offers from many organizations"" that his office has received ."
LA062390-0068,29,12,"""Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it"" ."
LA062390-0068,30,25,"Acknowledging Iran's strained relations with many nations, Zamani said his country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the country."
LA062390-0068,31,17,"As an example, he said ""no formalities"" will be required for relief planes flying into Iran ."
LA062390-0068,32,32,"He added, however, that aid shipments will be coordinated by the government and routed through Tehran because there are no other airports in the country that can accommodate large transport planes ."
LA062390-0068,33,13,"Meanwhile, other U.S. groups were rushing to supply Iran with emergency goods ."
LA062390-0068,34,36,"Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran today ."
LA062390-0068,35,13,"""We hope to be there about four days or so,"" he said ."

LA062590-0096,19,26,"In Iran, rescue efforts were hampered Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet jarred the already severely damaged rice-growing region of Rasht, 120 miles northwest of Tehran."
LA062590-0096,20,31,"The new shock, with a magnitude of 5.7, toppled the few still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province ."

LA062590-0096,26,24,The group set up the collection point in front of William R. Mason Regional Park on property belonging to the City of Irvine .
LA062590-0096,27,28,"Irvine Police Sgt. Tom Hume, who is in charge of policing special events held in the city, said the group failed to obtain a permit from the city."
LA062590-0096,28,25,"But police accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims."
LA062590-0096,29,13,The supplies were put into a large truck parked along the road .

SJMN91-06162032,10,20,"The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy."
SJMN91-06162032,11,16,"No casualties have been reported, but experts are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon."
SJMN91-06162032,12,27,"Gases, ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet."
SJMN91-06162032,13,26,The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters.
SJMN91-06162032,14,37,"Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the ""early eruptive stage"" and ""after that we will have bigger ones.""; He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from Clark."
SJMN91-06162032,15,27,"But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600 years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark."
SJMN91-06162032,16,29,"Rains fell across the area Sunday night, and officials warned residents in the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows."
SJMN91-06162032,17,4,Air Force spokesman Lt.
SJMN91-06162032,18,18,Col. Ron Rand announced the evacuation in a 5 a.m. broadcast over the U.S. military's Far East Network.
SJMN91-06162032,19,33,"An hour later, the first vehicles began rolling out of Clark for the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base, where the 14,500 troops, dependents and civilian employees will be housed until the danger passes."
SJMN91-06162032,20,9,"Another 1,500 troops remained at Clark to provide security."
SJMN91-06162032,21,15,"The Clark command center operated with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended."
SJMN91-06162032,22,18,The base is a major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military Airlift Command.
SJMN91-06162032,23,16,"The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading to Subic, about 50 miles southwest of Clark."
SJMN91-06162032,24,18,"U.S. Marines patrolled the highways, which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate, and U.S. helicopters hovered overhead."
SJMN91-06162032,25,12,"By late afternoon, U.S. officials said all the evacuees had reached Subic."
SJMN91-06162032,26,27,"""If it's going to blow, I hope it does it fast so I can go home before the cockroaches take my house,"" said Staff Sgt. Mike Huffman."
SJMN91-06162032,27,19,"Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila."
SJMN91-06162032,28,15,"In Angeles, residents reported no ash fell today but said the air smelled of sulfur."
SJMN91-06162032,29,38,"In southern Japan today, Mount Unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week, raising fears of deadly mudslides."
SJMN91-06162032,30,29,"Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police said."
SJMN91-06162032,31,28,"An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens more homes."
SJMN91-06162032,32,23,"In all, about 9,800 people have been evacuated from communities at the foot of the mountain, said police in Nagasaki, 30 miles away."
SJMN91-06162032,33,32,"Mount Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the ""Ring of Fire"" that circles the Pacific where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other, triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes."
SJMN91-06162032,34,20,"In the Philippines, officials have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces since Mount Pinatubo began erupting last week."
SJMN91-06162032,35,14,"About 3,100 of them are primitive Aeta tribes people who lived on Pinatubo's slopes."
SJMN91-06162032,36,13,Many of them walked or traveled by ox cart to flee the volcano.
SJMN91-06162032,37,27,But reporters found that some evacuees are returning to their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to evacuation centers at sundown.
SJMN91-06162032,38,22,Punongbayan said he flew to the area and warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins.
SJMN91-06162032,39,32,"There was no indication how long the Americans evacuated from Clark would stay at Subic, but they were ordered to take along important papers and food, water and clothing for three days."
SJMN91-06162032,40,30,Subic base spokesman Bob Coble said families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters.
SJMN91-06162032,41,18,"Mount Pinatubo, which last had a major eruption in 1380, began to show signs of activity in April."
SJMN91-06162032,42,10,"Last week, it belched small amounts of steam and ash."
SJMN91-06162032,43,12,There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines.
SJMN91-06162032,44,18,"The last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, exploded."
SJMN91-06162032,45,6,About 200 people were killed .

SJMN91-06163112,12,29,"A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said."
SJMN91-06163112,13,21,"If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said."
SJMN91-06163112,14,22,"Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north of Manila."
SJMN91-06163112,15,24,"Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said."
SJMN91-06163112,16,24,"Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said."
SJMN91-06163112,17,26,"The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano."
SJMN91-06163112,18,36,"The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches."
SJMN91-06163112,19,24,"Mount Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the ""Ring of Fire"" on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas."
SJMN91-06163112,20,71,"(These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in Washington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.); Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980."
SJMN91-06163112,21,23,"Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well."
SJMN91-06163112,22,24,Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.
SJMN91-06163112,23,42,"If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path."
SJMN91-06163112,24,22,"""In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered"" with glowing ash, Lipman said."
SJMN91-06163112,25,14,Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal.
SJMN91-06163112,26,10,That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.
SJMN91-06163112,27,17,"Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman said."
SJMN91-06163112,28,26,Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit.
SJMN91-06163112,29,11,"So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base."
SJMN91-06163112,30,20,"But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base."
SJMN91-06163112,31,31,"The volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman said."
SJMN91-06163112,32,18,"The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside."
SJMN91-06163112,33,12,On clear days they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.
SJMN91-06163112,34,16,Their predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already.
SJMN91-06163112,35,26,But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
SJMN91-06163112,36,21,"Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size."

SJMN91-06164210,23,10,The base did not appear immediately threatened by volcanic flow.
SJMN91-06164210,24,19,"Seismologists said searing gas, ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountain's western and northern slopes."

SJMN91-06165048,19,51,"The initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 8:51 a.m. Wednesday sent a 10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over Clark Air Base, forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment."
SJMN91-06165048,20,33,"Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life."

SJMN91-06165048,22,22,Many of the villages in the vicinity were holding Independence Day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began raining ash Wednesday morning.

SJMN91-06167046,10,25,But it quickly weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered about 70 miles east of the volcano.
SJMN91-06167046,11,30,"Still, heavy rains churned up by the typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away."
SJMN91-06167046,12,35,"Meanwhile, President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans."
SJMN91-06167046,13,45,"The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo."

SJMN91-06167046,21,25,"Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed."
SJMN91-06167046,22,9,"Gray ash also fell in Manila, 60 miles south."
SJMN91-06167046,23,27,"At Subic, base spokesman Robert Coble said generators had to be shut down from time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness."

AP890517-0106,7,41,"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks''."
AP890517-0106,8,20,"The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive."
AP890517-0106,9,6,"The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I."
AP890517-0106,10,6,", and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif."
AP890517-0106,11,8,", voted ``present,'' meaning they took no position."
AP890517-0106,12,14,Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts ``containing the distasteful specifics of Mr.
AP890517-0106,13,2,Secchia's remarks''.
AP890517-0106,14,37,"At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast."
AP890517-0106,15,6,But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
AP890517-0106,16,11,"``Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful diplomats,'' Pell said."
AP890517-0106,17,17,``Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to Italy''.
AP890517-0106,18,26,"``Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country,'' the chairman said."
AP890517-0106,19,27,"``I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States,'' Pell said."

AP890715-0076,9,33,"Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show."
AP890715-0076,10,38,"Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated ``unqualified'' by the American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of state."
AP890715-0076,11,31,"One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee."
AP890715-0076,12,15,The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
AP890715-0076,13,45,The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for Foreign Service professionals.
AP890715-0076,14,14,Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is ``in a confirmation process''.
AP890715-0076,15,31,A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an ``excellent'' candidate for an ambassadorship because of his ``solid background in law and management''.
AP890715-0076,16,5,It also cited another qualification.
AP890715-0076,17,21,"``Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100,'' the State Department said."
AP890715-0076,18,29,"The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100 designates people who have donated $100,000 or more."
AP890715-0076,19,27,"Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week."
AP890715-0076,20,21,"They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in 1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year."

AP890715-0076,42,26,"But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirements of the job."

AP890715-0076,48,31,"``It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list,'' Sarbanes said."
AP890715-0076,49,18,"Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished records."

AP900102-0114,13,24,Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as president.
AP900102-0114,14,13,Independent observers mostly concluded Endara had won the elections by a hefty margin.
AP900102-0114,15,13,Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is not in session.
AP900102-0114,16,20,That means Hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation.
AP900102-0114,17,31,"The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with Panama."
AP900102-0114,18,25,"Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S. intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida."

AP900102-0114,23,25,"Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official."
AP900102-0114,24,26,Officials described Hinton as ``an experienced Latin America hand'' and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the South American country.
AP900102-0114,25,26,"On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his ``wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America''."

AP900420-0006,9,31,"President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed sources."

AP900420-0006,11,21,"They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday."
AP900420-0006,12,14,They also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts.
AP900420-0006,13,11,Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America gone to women.
AP900420-0006,14,3,In choosing Ms.
AP900420-0006,15,24,"Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified."

AP900420-0006,17,7,Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish.
AP900420-0006,18,30,"Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is considered ``99.9 percent certain,'' one source said."

AP900420-0006,25,22,"The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling Contra rebels."
AP900420-0006,26,25,"But the request has been stalled by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua."
AP900420-0006,27,30,Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country.
AP900420-0006,28,8,The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
AP900420-0006,29,4,"Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C."
AP900420-0006,30,28,", a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government."

AP900510-0029,10,37,"The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives."
AP900510-0029,11,38,The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
AP900510-0029,12,20,Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare.
AP900510-0029,13,12,The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988.
AP900510-0029,14,26,"At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs."

AP900510-0029,16,29,"Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation."
AP900510-0029,17,29,He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
AP900510-0029,18,27,"Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua but said he was not interested."

AP900510-0029,20,23,"When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday."
AP900510-0029,21,29,"In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan."

AP900510-0029,23,19,", and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination."
AP900510-0029,24,22,"When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late 1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 months."

FBIS3-13911,15,13,"Ambassador""] [Text] The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is a heavyweight."
FBIS3-13911,16,7,Once the second man in the U.S.
FBIS3-13911,17,16,"Embassy in Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and a European nation."
FBIS3-13911,18,24,His choice for the new job signals the importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute.
FBIS3-13911,19,44,"Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials and went on to confirm his nomination."
FBIS3-13911,20,27,"In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the United States and Jordan and enhance Jordan's role in the peace process."
FBIS3-13911,21,23,He pointed out that Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries.
FBIS3-13911,22,31,His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace.
FBIS3-13911,23,18,"Mr. Egan will pay special attention to stability in Jordan, and watch its democratic march and economic development."
FBIS3-13911,24,49,"He will also watch Jordan's approach to a number of other issues: human rights, compliance with the sanctions resolution against Iraq, terminating the boycott of U.S. companies doing business with Israel, the potential for foreign investment both in Jordan and elsewhere in the region, and the fight against terrorism."
FBIS3-13911,25,30,"Much as I take exception to some of the issues that will engage the new ambassador's attention, I concern myself here with a lecture Moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing."
FBIS3-13911,26,30,"Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who were they occupied by?"
FBIS3-13911,27,28,"These territories, contended the senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state of Israel."
FBIS3-13911,28,18,What Israel did was to take the West Bank from Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt.
FBIS3-13911,29,21,"Previously, these territories were part of the British mandate, and before that they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire."
FBIS3-13911,30,14,"Mr. Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are up for grabs."
FBIS3-13911,31,13,"The United States, he noted, never recognized Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank."
FBIS3-13911,32,14,His bottom line: Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's sovereignty.
FBIS3-13911,33,12,This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be Washington's official line.
FBIS3-13911,34,43,"However, they do mirror an undeclared U.S. line dictated by the all-powerful Zionist lobby -- a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting stance of the United States toward the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre ."
LA020289-0065,9,23,"President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday ."

LA020289-0065,11,40,"Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said ."

LA020289-0065,19,16,"He will replace Winston Lord, who has headed the American Embassy in Beijing since 1985 ."
LA020289-0065,20,13,"For the last three years, Lilley served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea."
LA020289-0065,21,37,"In that job, he was the principal American contact with South Korean leaders during the turbulent period when former President Chun Doo Hwan resigned and the current president, Roh Tae Woo, won a bitterly contested election ."
LA020289-0065,22,3,Returns to Washington
LA020289-0065,23,32,"Lilley left Seoul last month and returned to Washington, hoping to be appointed as assistant secretary of state in charge of U.S. policy in East Asia and the Pacific, sources said ."
LA020289-0065,24,24,"However, he failed to get that job, in part because newly appointed Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger opposed him, the sources said."
LA020289-0065,25,26,Eagleburger was said to have been promoting two other candidates -- Lord and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt -- for the Asian post .

AP880916-0060,15,11,``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer.
AP880916-0060,16,7,"About one of six develop,'' said Clark."
AP880916-0060,17,8,"By Sept. 8, the system became a depression."
AP880916-0060,18,11,It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
AP880916-0060,19,10,A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
AP880916-0060,20,13,"When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm."
AP880916-0060,21,10,It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph.
AP880916-0060,22,23,"Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck."
AP880916-0060,23,21,"``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said Thursday."
AP880916-0060,24,9,``That's something meteorologists would like to know more about''.
AP880916-0060,25,13,But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins.
AP880916-0060,26,19,"And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place."
AP880916-0060,27,33,"``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck said."
AP880916-0060,28,18,"``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence pattern."
AP880916-0060,29,20,"That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation."
AP880916-0060,30,5,"Eventually, a vortex is created."
AP880916-0060,31,11,"``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning."
AP880916-0060,32,13,"That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those winter storms,'' Bleck said."
AP880916-0060,33,7,Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine.
AP880916-0060,34,16,"Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,'' he said."
AP880916-0060,35,18,"``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere."
AP880916-0060,36,14,That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere''.
AP880916-0060,37,14,"When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados, warm Atlantic waters nurtured it."
AP880916-0060,38,14,"``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development,'' Clark said."
AP880916-0060,39,18,"``If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode."
AP880916-0060,40,18,"This is where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast."
AP880916-0060,41,7,``It is an exciting thing to watch.
AP880916-0060,42,15,"If you're on the beach watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said."
AP880916-0060,43,23,"The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches Tuesday night."
AP880916-0060,44,15,That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys .
WSJ880912-0064,5,26,"Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba."
WSJ880912-0064,6,14,The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico.
WSJ880912-0064,7,18,"In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled."
WSJ880912-0064,8,38,"Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west."
WSJ880912-0064,9,4,"""It's still gaining strength."
WSJ880912-0064,10,29,"It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time,"" said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla."
WSJ880912-0064,11,25,"At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica."
WSJ880912-0064,12,21,The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours.
WSJ880912-0064,13,15,Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti.
WSJ880912-0064,14,20,The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve.
WSJ880912-0064,15,26,"The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight."
WSJ880912-0064,16,16,Hurricane warnings were issued for the south coast of Haiti and Cuba by their respective governments.
WSJ880912-0064,17,12,"In Jamaica, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island."
WSJ880912-0064,18,15,Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
WSJ880912-0064,19,30,"In Puerto Rico, besides tearing off several roofs, the storm caused coastal flooding and brought down power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions."
WSJ880912-0064,20,23,"Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported."

AP891018-0301,9,34,"Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday."
AP891018-0301,10,35,"Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home, according to industry spokesmen."
AP891018-0301,11,26,The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
AP891018-0301,12,23,"The organization estimated residential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured."
AP891018-0301,13,40,"Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill."
AP891018-0301,14,17,Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.
AP891018-0301,15,31,"In addition to home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers compensation."
AP891018-0301,16,15,Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more from the quake.
AP891018-0301,17,17,But industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims.
AP891018-0301,18,27,"``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group."
AP891018-0301,19,5,The insurers actually could benefit.
AP891018-0301,20,51,"Industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States earlier this month."
AP891018-0301,21,17,"An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term, the analysts said."
AP891018-0301,22,10,``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ...
AP891018-0301,23,23,"that this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. in New York."
AP891018-0301,24,21,"Despite their predictions for the long run, the analysts warned that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing."
AP891018-0301,25,21,"``It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,'' said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based Langen McAlenney."
AP891018-0301,26,13,"On the New York Stock Exchange, some insurance company stock rose on Wednesday."
AP891018-0301,27,31,"Aetna Life & Casualty Co. rose $2.37 to $59.50 a share; ITT Corp., parent of The Hartford, was up 37 cents to $59; and the Travelers Cos. rose $1 to $40.87."
AP891018-0301,28,11,"Reinsurance companies, which absorb risk from policy writers, did especially well."
AP891018-0301,29,16,General Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 and Marsh & McLennan Cos. rose $3.12 to $75.87.
AP891018-0301,30,10,"In California, earthquake insurance is an emotional and politically-charged issue."
AP891018-0301,31,25,"Roughly two-thirds of all insurance policies written in the United States are sold in California, where many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred.."
AP891018-0301,32,23,"Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage."
AP891018-0301,33,26,"Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said."
AP891018-0301,34,15,"They estimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more, business properties are insured."
AP891018-0301,35,22,"Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California voters last year."
AP891018-0301,36,11,The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback in insurance rates.

LA102089-0177,21,12,EARTHQUAKES -- SAN FRANCISCO; EARTHQUAKES -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; OAKLAND (CA); DISASTER VICTIMS
LA102489-0131,7,28,Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
LA102489-0131,8,44,"With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical."
LA102489-0131,9,30,"Deukmejian should be commended, as well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape ."
LA102489-0131,10,42,"The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it."
LA102489-0131,11,28,"While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: ""What did you know and when did you know it""?"
LA102489-0131,12,31,"The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake."
LA102489-0131,13,9,He was shocked that such a thing would happen.
LA102489-0131,14,36,"This has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that California stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration, possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase ."
LA102489-0131,15,18,"There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether something might have been done."
LA102489-0131,16,25,The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.
LA102489-0131,17,9,There has been no widespread outcry against the governor.
LA102489-0131,18,28,"While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds, the governor also sets general state priorities ."
LA102489-0131,19,25,The governor complained on Sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake.
LA102489-0131,20,31,But no one who has lived in California more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake.
LA102489-0131,21,19,"California is on the edge of earthquake-related technology, but still does not know everything that needs to be known."
LA102489-0131,22,22,"The state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday, Oct. 17 ."
LA102489-0131,23,44,But it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality.
LA102489-0131,24,26,"In the Bay Area, that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage, but face massive obstacles in getting to work ."
LA102489-0131,25,20,The governor and legislative leaders will meet again next Monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session.
LA102489-0131,26,26,It almost certainly would include a temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief.
LA102489-0131,27,25,Existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation to local governments.
LA102489-0131,28,9,But the need could well exceed the present reserve.
LA102489-0131,29,13,The scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge .
LA102489-0131,30,34,"The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to California."
LA102489-0131,31,25,The Legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained .
LA102489-0131,32,1,Editorial
WSJ891019-0021,9,15,The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly.
WSJ891019-0021,10,21,"In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning."
WSJ891019-0021,11,27,"Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action."
WSJ891019-0021,12,40,"Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now."
WSJ891019-0021,13,25,So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.
WSJ891019-0021,14,42,"By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters."
WSJ891019-0021,15,16,Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism.
WSJ891019-0021,16,35,"On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be ""less carping"" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency ""took a hit"" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo."
WSJ891019-0021,17,16,The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
WSJ891019-0021,18,17,He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so .
WSJ891019-0086,9,18,Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake.
WSJ891019-0086,10,32,Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
WSJ891019-0086,11,34,"The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division."
WSJ891019-0086,12,33,"But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers."
WSJ891019-0086,13,8,"Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains."
WSJ891019-0086,14,15,Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage.
WSJ891019-0086,15,18,"Most insurers already have mobilized their ""catastrophe"" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California."
WSJ891019-0086,16,31,"Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area."
WSJ891019-0086,17,16,"About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks."
WSJ891019-0086,18,27,"Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers."
WSJ891019-0086,19,24,Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims.
WSJ891019-0086,20,41,"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo."
WSJ891019-0086,21,17,"State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California."
WSJ891019-0086,22,26,"Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement ""rider"" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes."
WSJ891019-0086,23,15,State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
WSJ891019-0086,24,31,"Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage."
WSJ891019-0086,25,26,"The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said."
WSJ891019-0086,26,31,"Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today."
WSJ891019-0086,27,15,They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two.
WSJ891019-0086,28,17,Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
WSJ891019-0086,29,17,"Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage."
WSJ891019-0086,30,34,"Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds."
WSJ891019-0086,31,33,"However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have ""loss of income"" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days."
WSJ891019-0086,32,24,"That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia."
WSJ891019-0086,33,16,Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole.
WSJ891019-0086,34,33,"Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear."
WSJ891019-0086,35,17,"Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways."
WSJ891019-0086,36,20,"For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy."
WSJ891019-0086,37,35,"Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise."
WSJ891019-0086,38,10,Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves.
WSJ891019-0086,39,38,"""We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace,"" said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry."
WSJ891019-0086,40,14,"His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday."
WSJ891019-0086,41,35,"Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included American International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75.875."
WSJ891019-0086,42,12,"Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated."
WSJ891019-0086,43,24,"""I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this,"" said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult."
WSJ891019-0086,44,24,He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo.
WSJ891019-0086,45,19,"British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster."
WSJ891019-0086,46,23,"Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage."
WSJ891019-0086,47,20,"Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar."
WSJ891019-0086,48,29,The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire.
WSJ891019-0086,49,25,"Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion."
WSJ891019-0086,50,28,"He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo ."
AP900801-0004,8,14,"Iraqi troops have launched an offensive against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night."
AP900801-0004,9,22,"Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, ``We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment''."

AP901019-0072,15,39,"``Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell on the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us,'' guest conductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night."
AP901019-0072,16,37,"So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's ``Violin Concerto'' became Bernstein's ``Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion'' (1954); Shostakovich's ``Symphony No. 4'' became Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 1 (Jeremiah),'' written in 1942."
AP901019-0072,17,13,Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his overture to ``Candide'' (1956).
AP901019-0072,18,12,"The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday."
AP901019-0072,19,5,It was an extraordinary concert.
AP901019-0072,20,10,There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or musicians.
AP901019-0072,21,14,"Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the whimsical ``Candide,'' broke some of the tension."
AP901019-0072,22,18,"Then came the eclectic ``Serenade,'' which Bernstein's program notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium''."
AP901019-0072,23,13,"It begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love."
AP901019-0072,24,12,"The piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic."
AP901019-0072,25,27,"It ends in drunken revelry, an intrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven and telling the audience, ``It's O.K. to smile tonight''."
AP901019-0072,26,25,"The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with much agility, especially through the difficult double stops and especially considering the lack of preparation time."
AP901019-0072,27,9,"The mourning returned after intermission, but not without optimism."
AP901019-0072,28,24,"``Jeremiah'' begins with suspenseful strings, followed by a cantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then a prophetic blaring of brass."
AP901019-0072,29,21,"The second movement continues the point-counterpoint of brass versus strings (Jeremiah versus the corrupt priests, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon)."
AP901019-0072,30,11,"In the third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king."
AP901019-0072,31,3,Judea is exiled.
AP901019-0072,32,2,Jeremiah weeps.
AP901019-0072,33,19,``How she sits desolate - ``The city once so full of people - ``She is become as a widow''.
AP901019-0072,34,18,"During her chanting of the prophet's ``Lamentations,'' mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye."
AP901019-0072,35,6,S did members of the audience.
AP901019-0072,36,10,"Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, ``Chichester Psalms''."
AP901019-0072,37,12,The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the orchestra.
AP901019-0072,38,9,Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.
AP901019-0072,39,9,"``Awake, psaltery and harp''! the choir begins in Hebrew."
AP901019-0072,40,5,``I will rouse the dawn''.
AP901019-0072,41,23,"In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, sings King David's 23rd Psalm, ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want''."
AP901019-0072,42,12,"After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: ``Why do the nations rage''?"
AP901019-0072,43,33,"The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorus declaring a message Bernstein had sought for society: ``Behold how good, ``And how pleasant it is, ``For brethren to dwell ``Together in unity''."
AP901019-0072,44,18,"To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspended his hands for several long moments of silence."
AP901019-0072,45,6,Then came the cascade of applause.
AP901019-0072,46,4,For Leonard Bernstein .
AP901114-0087,9,34,"On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms''."
AP901114-0087,10,20,"Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron Copland."
AP901114-0087,11,17,"And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16."
AP901114-0087,12,22,"Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children, son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin."
AP901114-0087,13,18,Bernstein's daughter Jamie Thomas said her father had loved numerical coincidences ``and today there's a flock of them''.
AP901114-0087,14,34,"The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass,'' which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew, from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms''."
AP901114-0087,15,12,"Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett, Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine."
AP901114-0087,16,26,"The orchestra played the overture to Bernstein's ``Candide'' with a symbolically empty podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a standing ovation."
AP901114-0087,17,7,Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande.
AP901114-0087,18,24,"Singers were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin."
AP901114-0087,19,26,"First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part."
AP901114-0087,20,6,Two pieces by Copland were played.
AP901114-0087,21,16,"The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works."
AP901114-0087,22,27,"Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute for an ailing Bruno Walter ."
LA101590-0066,12,33,"Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment."
LA101590-0066,13,4,He was 72 .
LA101590-0066,14,37,"Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as ""Lenny,"" died at 6:15 p.m. in the presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure."
LA101590-0066,15,12,"On Cahill's advice, the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire."
LA101590-0066,16,24,Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working .
LA101590-0066,17,9,"In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency."
LA101590-0066,18,12,"His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19 ."
LA101590-0066,19,29,"Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano ."
LA101590-0066,20,27,"He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible ""West Side Story"" and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series ""Omnibus"" ."
LA101590-0066,21,39,"Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life."
LA101590-0066,22,27,"With it, he became a personality, well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show ."
LA101590-0066,23,20,"The dervish persona, including his upstart gymnastics on the podium, never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight ."
LA101590-0066,24,10,He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses.
LA101590-0066,25,22,"And he lifted popular music to a higher plane, infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound ."
LA101590-0066,26,22,"""Some conductors mellow with age,"" commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986."
LA101590-0066,27,34,"""(But) Bernstein, at 68, remains a frenetic combination of orbiting rocket, aerobics master, super-juggler, matinee idol, booming cannon, hysterical mime, heart-rending tragedian, bouncing ball, sky writer, riveting machine, mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble"" ."
LA101590-0066,28,35,"Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as ""the shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis"" ."
LA101590-0066,29,31,"Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized showmanship masked lazy, sloppy or inept musicianship, Bernstein could never have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades."
LA101590-0066,30,27,"He knew what he was doing, and the musicians he accompanied, wrote for, conducted, or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own ."
LA101590-0066,31,21,"Louis Bernstein (so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted) was born Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., to two Russian Jewish immigrants."
LA101590-0066,32,17,"His father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar."
LA101590-0066,33,17,"His mother, Jennie Resnick Bernstein, who survives him, said her son always had an ear for music."
LA101590-0066,34,16,"""When he was 4 or 5, he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill"" ."
LA101590-0066,35,11,"The parents preferred the name ""Leonard"" and called the boy that."
LA101590-0066,36,25,"When his kindergarten teacher asked ""Louis Bernstein"" to stand up, he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name."
LA101590-0066,37,16,"Bernstein changed his name legally at age 16, when he got his first driver's license ."
LA101590-0066,38,11,His mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident .
LA101590-0066,39,29,"When Bernstein was 10, a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents, and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it."
LA101590-0066,40,21,"He asked for lessons, and soon was playing better than his teacher, a neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson ."
LA101590-0066,41,35,"By age 12, he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had determined, despite his father's objections, that music -- at that point playing the piano -- would be his career ."
LA101590-0066,42,23,"Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading, remembering complicated scores, and improvisation became evident as he played, and altered, classical, jazz and popular music."
LA101590-0066,43,27,"He produced his own shows and versions of ""The Mikado"" and ""Carmen,"" and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra ."
LA101590-0066,44,20,He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School .
LA101590-0066,45,23,"At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland ."
LA101590-0066,46,15,"A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident."
LA101590-0066,47,21,"Invited to a dance recital in New York, Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize."
LA101590-0066,48,18,"Invited afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland, Bernstein commandeered the piano and played Copland's ""Piano Variations""."
LA101590-0066,49,17,"His performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony, who of course was Copland ."
LA101590-0066,50,4,They became lifelong friends.
LA101590-0066,51,21,Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and Hawkes.
LA101590-0066,52,20,"Ironically, Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make conducting, rather than composing or even piano playing, his career ."
LA101590-0066,53,32,"Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year -- 1937, his sophomore year at Harvard -- when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus."
LA101590-0066,54,18,Mitropoulos was so impressed with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the Boston Symphony.
LA101590-0066,55,19,"The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch ."
LA101590-0066,56,61,"""The influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all,"" Bernstein wrote years later, after his mentors had all died, ""because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner."
LA101590-0066,57,56,". . . But long before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos . . . and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I wasn't even aware of until many years later"" ."
LA101590-0066,58,21,"Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein asked Mitropoulos what he should do ."
LA101590-0066,59,21,"""You must be a conductor,"" Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia."
LA101590-0066,60,19,"It was fall and conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia for two years ."
LA101590-0066,61,26,"During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home, Tanglewood ."
LA101590-0066,62,18,"""He became like a surrogate father to me,"" Bernstein later said of Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor."
LA101590-0066,63,27,"""He had no children of his own and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all."
LA101590-0066,64,16,". . . And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then Reiner, and now Koussevitzky."
LA101590-0066,65,10,"But the Koussevitzky relationship was very special, very warm"" ."
LA101590-0066,66,14,Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood annually to conduct and teach.
LA101590-0066,67,23,He so revered the maestro that he was married in Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links .
LA101590-0066,68,22,It was Koussevitzky -- and fate -- who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25 .
LA101590-0066,69,34,"On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm ."
LA101590-0066,70,11,"""I am going to need an assistant conductor,"" Rodzinsky told him."
LA101590-0066,71,43,"""I have gone through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I shall take and God said, 'Take Bernstein,' "" he said, granting the position as a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky ."
LA101590-0066,72,24,"Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium."
LA101590-0066,73,13,"In the orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on ."
LA101590-0066,74,9,"But for ""Lucky Lenny"" history made an exception ."
LA101590-0066,75,27,"On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm ."
LA101590-0066,76,39,"Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's ""I Hate Music"" at her Town Hall debut the previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and he had played for her and the post-recital party ."
LA101590-0066,77,22,"With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio ."
LA101590-0066,78,17,"The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an editorial: ""Mr."
LA101590-0066,79,14,Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity.
LA101590-0066,80,9,. . . It's a good American success story.
LA101590-0066,81,15,"The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves"" ."
LA101590-0066,82,18,Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York Philharmonic in 1957-58.
LA101590-0066,83,6,He had no time for one.
LA101590-0066,84,15,He was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor .
LA101590-0066,85,28,"Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits ."
LA101590-0066,86,18,"""It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities,"" Bernstein wrote in 1946."
LA101590-0066,87,14,"""What seems right for me at any given moment is what I must do."
LA101590-0066,88,19,". . . The ends are music itself . . . and the means are my private problem"" ."
LA101590-0066,89,12,The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime.
LA101590-0066,90,13,Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career .
LA101590-0066,91,30,"His first major composition, a symphony titled ""Jeremiah,"" was introduced in 1942, and his first ballet, ""Fancy Free,"" and related first musical, ""On the Town,"" both debuted in 1944 ."
LA101590-0066,92,41,"He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies (""Jeremiah"" was followed by ""The Age of Anxiety"" in 1949 and ""Kaddish"" in 1963), sonatas, and the operas ""Trouble in Tahiti"" in 1953 and ""A Quiet Place"" in 1983 ."
LA101590-0066,93,17,"In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center."
LA101590-0066,94,32,"He followed ""On the Town"" with the musicals ""Wonderful Town"" in 1953, the score for the film ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954, and the critically acclaimed but less popular ""Candide"" in 1956."
LA101590-0066,95,12,"His best and best-remembered work, ""West Side Story,"" debuted in 1957 ."
LA101590-0066,96,34,"""If I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can understand (and one that is, notwithstanding, a serious musical work), I shall be a happy man,"" Bernstein said in 1948 ."
LA101590-0066,97,37,"When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with ""West Side Story,"" he disagreed, saying: ""There are moments when I think so, but as a sum total it fails to be an opera."
LA101590-0066,98,12,"Because at the denouement, at the dramatic unraveling, the music stops ."
LA101590-0066,99,23,"""But I don't love it any less,"" he added, reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced."
LA101590-0066,100,10,"""It doesn't make it a stepchild or a foundling"" ."
LA101590-0066,101,32,"In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973 ."
LA101590-0066,102,25,"It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his ""Young People's Concerts"" of the Philharmonic and ""Omnibus,"" that Bernstein taught the nation ."
LA101590-0066,103,42,"""An assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other performers,"" conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein wrote in Harper's in 1983 ."
LA101590-0066,104,26,"Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public Broadcasting System ."
LA101590-0066,105,27,"Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, ""displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, its complexity, or its simple genius."
LA101590-0066,106,27,"No one before or since Bernstein has been so effective -- artistically and commercially -- in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience"" ."
LA101590-0066,107,10,The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award .
LA101590-0066,108,23,Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic.
LA101590-0066,109,22,"He introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance ."
LA101590-0066,110,24,"He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to have more time for composing and guest conducting ."
LA101590-0066,111,22,"If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life."
LA101590-0066,112,30,"Known for his emotional embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country home ."
LA101590-0066,113,28,"A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people ."
LA101590-0066,114,19,"""God knows, I should be dead by now,"" he said as he approached 70, characteristically cavalier about his health."
LA101590-0066,115,2,"""I smoke."

LA101590-0066,124,34,"Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had many homosexual affairs (Bernstein promised his children never to read the book), there was no question that he adored his family."
LA101590-0066,125,39,"On Sept. 9, 1951, he married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978 ."
LA101590-0066,126,20,"Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton ."

LA121490-0148,10,20,Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater.
LA121490-0148,11,28,"Longtime friends and colleagues -- those who knew him as Lenny -- paid tribute to the musical-theater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words, and often in song ."
LA121490-0148,12,49,"The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days ."
LA121490-0148,13,21,"Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for ""West Side Story,"" hosted the 75-minute tribute to Bernstein, 72, who died Oct. 14."
LA121490-0148,14,22,"""Wherever Lenny was, was theater; his every move was a stage direction,"" he said, as many in the audience laughed knowingly ."
LA121490-0148,15,38,"Another ""West Side Story"" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory words: ""Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and Jerome Robbins"" ."
LA121490-0148,16,37,"After noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to Bernstein by performing the sailor's variation he created in the ballet ""Fancy Free,"" Robbins, 72, recalled that halcyon 1944 collaboration between the two 25-year-olds."
LA121490-0148,17,25,"He also reflected on the joyous nature of their 1957 ""West Side Story"" collaboration, even while the show faced repeated obstacles before reaching Broadway ."
LA121490-0148,18,8,"""Lenny's music was the lifeblood of that show."
LA121490-0148,19,30,"His theater scores weren't just a collection of songs but were more like a symphonic work,"" noted Robbins, who also collaborated on several other ballet and theater works with Bernstein."
LA121490-0148,20,15,"He concluded in subdued tones, ""We have lost a maker and shaker of our century."
LA121490-0148,21,7,"A light went out for me"" ."
LA121490-0148,22,18,"Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of ""West Side Story,"" sang a medley of ""I Feel Pretty"" and ""Tonight""."
LA121490-0148,23,42,"The ""West Side Story"" reunion was not as complete as had been scheduled; Larry Kert was unable to be there, and Stephen Sondheim (who, then a newcomer to Broadway, wrote the lyrics) could not attend due to illness in his family ."
LA121490-0148,24,14,Original cast members from Bernstein shows sang numbers they had helped launch into history.
LA121490-0148,25,13,"Nancy Walker sang her sassy ""I Can Cook Too"" from ""On the Town""."
LA121490-0148,26,36,"Her fellow cast members, Betty Comden and Adolph Green (who also teamed with Bernstein as the show's creators), after fondly recalling their 50-year friendship with Bernstein, poignantly sang the show's bittersweet finale, ""Some Other Time"" ."
LA121490-0148,27,21,"Barbara Cook, the original Cunegonde in Bernstein's ""Candide"" (1956), displayed her still-gleaming voice in ""A Simple Song"" from Bernstein's 1971 ""Mass""."
LA121490-0148,28,21,"""Candide"" itself was represented by ""Glitter and Be Gay,"" the coloratura aria Cook made famous, as performed by Constance Haumann ."

LA121490-0148,30,26,"Kurt Ollmann, familiar from Bernstein's 1985 ""West Side Story"" recording, sang ""Take Care of This House"" from Bernstein's last (1976), unsuccessful, Broadway show, ""1600 Pennsylvania Ave""."
LA121490-0148,31,12,-- a work the composer often spoke of wanting to revise .
LA121490-0148,32,28,"Bernstein's son, Alexander, delivered a funny, knowing, affectionate talk about his father's unappreciated skills as an actor, singer and dancer as only a family member could know them."
LA121490-0148,33,36,"Michael Wager, a very close friend of Bernstein's who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy ."
LA121490-0148,34,48,"Marilyn Horne closed the program with ""Somewhere,"" the emotional anthem from ""West Side Story,"" after which Laurents directed the audience's attention to the large photo that hung over the stage: an exuberant 39-year-old Bernstein, nearly levitating outside the theater where ""West Side Story"" had opened in Washington ."
LA121490-0148,35,28,"Since ""Lenny didn't like silence,"" Laurents asked instead for a final round of applause for the man who inspired and moved so many people for so many years."

AP890426-0185,15,40,"She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise."
AP890426-0185,16,19,"She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said."
AP890426-0185,17,10,"``There was nothing to indicate this would happen,'' Wise said."
AP890426-0185,18,12,``The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death''.
AP890426-0185,19,13,"In the 6-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve."
AP890426-0185,20,28,"Although the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass."
AP890426-0185,21,23,"Kass, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta ``progressed all the way down into her abdomen''."
AP890426-0185,22,24,"Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format."
AP890426-0185,23,12,"``I and 100 million others will miss her,'' said comedian George Burns."
AP890426-0185,24,21,``But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on''.
AP890426-0185,25,7,``Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter.
AP890426-0185,26,19,"But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love,'' President Bush said in a statement."
AP890426-0185,27,10,``She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit.
AP890426-0185,28,8,She was not merely an actress or comedienne.
AP890426-0185,29,7,She was Lucy and she was loved''.
AP890426-0185,30,29,"``Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution,'' former President and Nancy Reagan said in a statement."
AP890426-0185,31,9,``Just the mention of her name brings a smile.
AP890426-0185,32,9,... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply''.
AP890426-0185,33,28,"``It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years,'' said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta."
AP890426-0185,34,26,"While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe."
AP890426-0185,35,27,"Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns."
AP890426-0185,36,14,"The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz."
AP890426-0185,37,22,"Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wails and exaggerated pratfalls made the ``I Love Lucy'' show one of the most popular in television history."
AP890426-0185,38,28,Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to watch Lucy and Ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that would push their long-suffering husbands to exasperation.
AP890426-0185,39,39,"Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky."
AP890426-0185,40,13,The real birth occurred just four hours before the previously-filmed show was broadcast.
AP890426-0185,41,15,Miss Ball's singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business entrepreneur.
AP890426-0185,42,11,She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent studios.
AP890426-0185,43,30,"Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and '60s, including ``December Bride,'' ``Our Miss Brooks'' and ``Make Room for Daddy''."
AP890426-0185,44,42,"As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today."
AP890426-0185,45,11,The couple stopped making weekly ``I Love Lucy'' shows in 1957.
AP890426-0185,46,18,"Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960."
AP890426-0185,47,31,"In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly ``Here's Lucy'' and ``The Lucy Show''."
AP890426-0185,48,19,"Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist."
AP890426-0185,49,46,"Young Lucy, a brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions were discouraged by an acting school _ ``They sent my mother a letter saying she was wasting her money,'' Miss Ball once said _ and she turned to modeling under the name Diane Belmont."
AP890426-0185,50,15,"Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught Hollywood's eye, and in 1933 she went to California."
AP890426-0185,51,29,"As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx Brothers in ``Room Service,'' with Fred Astaire in ``Follow the Fleet'' and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in ``Stage Door''."
AP890426-0185,52,9,"In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies."
AP890426-0185,53,16,"In 1940, her tresses colored the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba star."
AP890426-0185,54,5,They married within six months.
AP890426-0185,55,23,"In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, ``My Favorite Husband,'' to television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star."
AP890426-0185,56,14,But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with the American public.
AP890426-0185,57,26,"The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent."
AP890426-0185,58,10,They also produced their own pilot episode on borrowed money.
AP890426-0185,59,10,"CBS relented, and ``I Love Lucy'' was an immediate success."
AP890426-0185,60,11,The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the days before videotape.
AP890426-0185,61,21,"It was filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three cameras instead of the traditional one used for motion pictures."
AP890426-0185,62,31,"The actress was last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and laughed freely throughout her brief bit with Bob Hope."
AP890426-0185,63,23,"Her last series _ ``Life with Lucy,'' once again co-starring Gordon _ was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season."
AP890426-0185,64,22,"But the show, her first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings."
AP890426-0185,65,3,She ``felt terrible.
AP890426-0185,66,12,"... It really devastated her,'' daughter Lucie Arnaz said at the time."
AP890426-0185,67,24,"Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie ``Stone Pillow,'' considered one of the most challenging roles of her career."
AP890426-0185,68,19,"She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but the movie was a minor critical and ratings success."
AP890426-0185,69,19,"Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported $750,000 with Putnam to publish her autobiography."
AP890426-0185,70,15,Said CBS Chairman William Paley: ``Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS.
AP890426-0185,71,20,... Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever''.
AP890426-0185,72,5,Funeral arrangements were pending .
AP890426-0204,8,32,"Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny."
AP890426-0204,9,31,"``Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,'' the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview."
AP890426-0204,10,9,"``She never saw it, but she was extremely amusing''."
AP890426-0204,11,38,"Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend."
AP890426-0204,12,9,"``The world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said."
AP890426-0204,13,16,``I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ...
AP890426-0204,14,18,"a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only one I've ever really known''."
AP890426-0204,15,21,"In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68."
AP890426-0204,16,12,The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on ``Here's Lucy''.
AP890426-0204,17,12,They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived ``Life With Lucy''.
AP890426-0204,18,22,"Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on television."
AP890426-0204,19,14,"``I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very talented,'' he recalled."
AP890426-0204,20,7,``She was very pleasant to work with.
AP890426-0204,21,21,None of us knew what was going to happen _ television was very young then and it wasn't taken too seriously.
AP890426-0204,22,12,We never dreamed it would ever become the power it was ...
AP890426-0204,23,7,and the great stars it would produce''.
AP890426-0204,24,30,"Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years''."
AP890426-0204,25,17,Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West.
AP890426-0204,26,18,He is currently appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in the play ``Mass Appeal''.
AP890426-0204,27,21,The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral.
AP890426-0204,28,14,"``I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work,'' he said."
AP890426-0204,29,15,``She would be the first one to scream her head off if I did that.''

AP890427-0014,12,2,HOLLYWOOD (AP)
AP890427-0014,13,7,She never knew how great she was.
AP890427-0014,14,16,"Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, Lucille Ball stood out like an orange beacon."
AP890427-0014,15,3,She never bragged.
AP890427-0014,16,6,She never exercised her considerable power.
AP890427-0014,17,12,"She always seemed astonished, even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way."
AP890427-0014,18,35,"When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: ``There comes a time in your life when you get a lot of plaques."
AP890427-0014,19,14,"It's very flattering and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children''."
AP890427-0014,20,26,"Whenever she was praised for ``I Love Lucy,'' she invariably replied: ``Well, all of the credit should go to (writers) Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr''."
AP890427-0014,21,12,"Or, ``Desi was a genius: He was responsible for the show's success''."
AP890427-0014,22,10,"Or she cited co-stars Desi, Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley."
AP890427-0014,23,20,"Yes, the writing and producing and casting of ``I Love Lucy'' were marvelous, but Lucy's performance added the quantum force."
AP890427-0014,24,32,Her inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating.
AP890427-0014,25,9,"Unlike many stars, Lucille Ball rarely indulged in self-analysis."
AP890427-0014,26,40,"But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings about the ``I Love Lucy'' triumph might have been ambivalent: Living through the last five years of the show, she said, ``took the edge off any enjoyment I might have had."
AP890427-0014,27,13,"Desi's drinking and carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's self-esteem."
AP890427-0014,28,7,The talk around town was `poor Lucy'.
AP890427-0014,29,14,"Because I couldn't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5 years."
AP890427-0014,30,15,"``I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and actually, working together was a blessing."
AP890427-0014,31,14,Desi had everything so well organized that it was easy to do the work''.
AP890427-0014,32,8,Lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential.
AP890427-0014,33,13,She was 40 when ``I Love Lucy'' started on CBS and revolutionized television.
AP890427-0014,34,39,"And although she spent many years in Hollywood, ``none of the studios ever designed comedies for me the way MGM did for Red Skelton, Paramount did for Bob Hope and Sam Goldwyn did for Danny Kaye,'' she once said."
AP890427-0014,35,40,"``Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half for a movie to come out,'' she said in an interview late in life."
AP890427-0014,36,11,"``Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it."
AP890427-0014,37,4,``It was all new.
AP890427-0014,38,5,Nobody knew anything about television.
AP890427-0014,39,11,"Nobody was there to say, `No, don't do that, it's wrong'!"
AP890427-0014,40,10,We never knew what was wrong and what was right.
AP890427-0014,41,6,We were all feeling our way.
AP890427-0014,42,23,"Desi was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was very intent on going ahead and doing it: `That sounds all right, let's go'!"
AP890427-0014,43,3,So we went''.
AP890427-0014,44,6,Always the credit to someone else.
AP890427-0014,45,10,But millions upon millions of television watchers know otherwise .
AP890427-0052,10,29,"As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled."
AP890427-0052,11,24,"``She always talked about being a star,'' said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her."
AP890427-0052,12,25,"Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake."
AP890427-0052,13,13,Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as ``daring in many ways''.
AP890427-0052,14,11,"``She tried to get me to run off (to Broadway),'' Mrs."
AP890427-0052,15,2,Lopus added.
AP890427-0052,16,6,``But I didn't have the nerve''.
AP890427-0052,17,26,"At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice."
AP890427-0052,18,28,"Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown."
AP890427-0052,19,19,"Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friends."
AP890427-0052,20,19,"``Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us,'' said Irene Rosseti of Celoron."
AP890427-0052,21,18,Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.
AP890427-0052,22,18,"Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson."
AP890427-0052,23,27,"On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000."
AP890427-0052,24,14,Residents had put up posters saying ``Jamestown Loves Lucy'' in storefronts and home windows.
AP890427-0052,25,24,"After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting."
AP890427-0052,26,9,"More than 150 posters were sent with 10,000 signatures."
AP890427-0052,27,30,"The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery."
AP890427-0052,28,18,"``It is a sad day for all of us,'' said Nelson Garifi, an organizer of the welcoming event."
AP890427-0052,29,13,``But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world''.
AP890427-0052,30,16,"Garifi, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously."
AP890427-0052,31,32,Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up _ it will be renamed Lucy Lane.
AP890427-0052,32,18,Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month.
AP890427-0052,33,14,"``But it will happen anyway,'' John Goodell of the village's historical society said Wednesday."
AP890427-0052,34,34,"When the society was formed about a year ago, Goodell said: ``We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership."
AP890427-0052,35,18,``It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high.''
AP890427-0098,11,34,"An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy."
AP890427-0098,12,29,"The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center."
AP890427-0098,13,11,She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery.
AP890427-0098,14,16,"A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes."
AP890427-0098,15,19,"``God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope."
AP890427-0098,16,19,"Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said."
AP890427-0098,17,20,Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.
AP890427-0098,18,13,Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill.
AP890427-0098,19,29,"Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: ``Wouldn't you know _ this is the day I was going to get my hair done''."
AP890427-0098,20,17,"Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock."
AP890427-0098,21,8,"``She had been walking, her spirits were up."
AP890427-0098,22,7,"Her family was with her,'' Wise said."
AP890427-0098,23,13,``She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery''.
AP890427-0098,24,34,"He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta."
AP890427-0098,25,18,"Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957."
AP890427-0098,26,23,"In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz."
AP890427-0098,27,24,"``Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,'' said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom ``Kate and Allie''."
AP890427-0098,28,10,"``But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows''."
AP890427-0098,29,24,"The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls."
AP890427-0098,30,16,"``Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy,'' recalled Joan Rivers."
AP890427-0098,31,20,``What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime''.
AP890427-0098,32,12,Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: ``Lucy was great because she represented every person.
AP890427-0098,33,14,She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves''.
AP890427-0098,34,28,"Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the ``I Love Lucy'' characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant."
AP890427-0098,35,18,"``That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant,'' Miss Goldberg said."
AP890427-0098,36,16,"``She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously."
AP890427-0098,37,12,And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy''.
AP890427-0098,38,47,"Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989'' appeared."
AP890427-0098,39,9,``I felt I had lost someone in my family.
AP890427-0098,40,7,"I couldn't believe it,'' said Rosati, 40."
AP890427-0098,41,9,``I was watching Lucy like I do every morning.
AP890427-0098,42,9,She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town''.
AP890427-0098,43,26,He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house.
AP890427-0098,44,8,Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.
AP890427-0098,45,24,"On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars _ one for her film work, one for television."
AP890427-0098,46,18,"Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, ``The world of comedy has lost its first lady."
AP890427-0098,47,7,Her death is an irreparable loss ...
AP890427-0098,48,3,to our industry''.
AP890427-0098,49,23,Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series ``Taxi''.

LA042789-0025,20,41,"From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and '40s to the television career that made her a legend, Miss Ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches ."
LA042789-0025,21,27,"Almost humbly, she liked to say she owed her enormous success, not so much to talent, but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players."
LA042789-0025,22,34,"Her greatest achievements, she always would add, were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children, Lucie in 1951 and Desi Jr., two years later ."

LA042789-0025,30,22,"It was ""I Love Lucy,"" which premiered on CBS on Oct. 15, 1951, that earned Miss Ball her niche in television history."
LA042789-0025,31,20,The 30-minute comedy starred Miss Ball and the Cuban-born Arnaz as the wacky Lucy Ricardo and her conga-playing husband Ricky.
LA042789-0025,32,23,The show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time -- of almost any time .
LA042789-0025,33,3,Stopped the Nation
LA042789-0025,34,28,"In creating the show, Miss Ball and Arnaz -- who died in 1986 -- set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come."
LA042789-0025,35,22,"They filmed the programs in front of a live audience and in doing so, invented the popular and financially rewarding rerun ."
LA042789-0025,36,23,The show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation every Monday night from 9 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
LA042789-0025,37,38,"In fact, nighttime shoppers became so scarce in Chicago that the mammoth Marshall Field department store posted a sign that read: ""We Love Lucy, too, so from now on we will be open Thursday night instead of Monday""."

LA042789-0025,44,17,"A generation of Americans grew to recap their favorite Lucy episodes, plot twist by crazy twist ."
LA042789-0025,45,34,There was the time Lucy schemed her way onto Ricky's television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes .
LA042789-0025,46,32,Then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her Manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf .

LA042789-0025,65,8,"""I loved doing all those pregnant shows"" ."
LA042789-0025,66,21,"Astoundingly, or so it seems in retrospect, early reviews of Miss Ball's talents gave little hint of what was to come."
LA042789-0025,67,26,"In fact, when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway, Miss Ball was told by a drama teacher to give up."
LA042789-0025,68,8,"Luckily, the turquoise-eyed teen-ager ignored the advice ."

LA042789-0025,73,23,There was a brief stint in a Ziegfeld Follies road show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of Broadway chorus lines .
LA042789-0025,74,32,"Changing her name to Diane Belmont (""I always loved the name Diane and I was driving past the Belmont race track, and the names seemed to fit together"") she turned to modeling."

LA042789-0068,9,32,"Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' greatest gift to television ."
LA042789-0068,10,34,"It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in ""Roman Scandals"" with Eddie Cantor in 1933."
LA042789-0068,11,30,"She had had bit parts in two earlier films but ""Roman Scandals"" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career ."
LA042789-0068,12,6,The movies prepared her for television.
LA042789-0068,13,26,"She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers (""Room Service"") ."
LA042789-0068,14,16,A lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film history.
LA042789-0068,15,40,"But in those years Lucy was refining her enduring, endearing public image as a perky, saucy woman who was likelier (at least in the early days) to end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself ."
LA042789-0068,16,35,"Yet as often happened with supporting performers, her verve, an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the square-cut principals, and led to leading roles ."
LA042789-0068,17,23,"To look at the ""I Love Lucy"" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, is to realize how superbly professional they are."
LA042789-0068,18,19,"Today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique, shooting in front of live audiences, that Desi Arnaz pioneered ."
LA042789-0068,19,43,"The idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins, and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without Lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne ."
LA042789-0068,20,33,"She made it all -- even the wildest, craziest capers -- look as if it were happening now -- spontaneous, unrehearsed, accidental, the inevitable consequences of the screen Lucy's scatterbrained and lovable personality."
LA042789-0068,21,26,"Her foils -- Desi himself, Vivian Vance and William Frawley -- were superb farceurs themselves, but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work ."
LA042789-0068,22,12,"The craft was invisible, the skills so perfected they concealed themselves totally."
LA042789-0068,23,25,"It was a brilliant illusion, generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing ."
LA042789-0068,24,18,The result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in television's history thus far.
LA042789-0068,25,18,The appeal of the Lucy shows was also the most universal that American television has yet provided .
LA042789-0068,26,13,"They were wholly, prototypically American, and that is central to their popularity abroad."
LA042789-0068,27,22,Yet they have been embraced as the kind of middle-class goings-on that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class.
LA042789-0068,28,11,"Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world ."
LA042789-0068,29,26,"Her successful career in films, in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status, gave her an invaluable identification when ""I Love Lucy"" began."
LA042789-0068,30,28,"The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies ."
LA042789-0068,31,38,"Indeed, when Lucy began to commandeer our hearts on ""I Love Lucy"" in 1951, the movies were already in considerable trouble, their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of Lucy in their living rooms."
LA042789-0068,32,7,"As always, her timing was impeccable ."
LA042789-0068,33,7,"Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course."
LA042789-0068,34,23,"She had come a hard road from Jamestown, N.Y., in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained."
LA042789-0068,35,19,"She was smart, hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was, comedy was not accidental ."
LA042789-0068,36,45,"Then again, the cameras, television or film, have X-ray properties, and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman, as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing ."

AP880314-0110,8,29,"The communist world gets its first McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica."
AP880314-0110,9,42,"The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade's main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the other specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West."
AP880314-0110,10,26,The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.
AP880314-0110,11,19,"Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions, and it is served on bread and eaten with the hands."
AP880314-0110,12,14,It is sold at fast-food restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.
AP880314-0110,13,26,"``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largest state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's."
AP880314-0110,14,23,"John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in a communist country."
AP880314-0110,15,25,"The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic, another Genex official."
AP880314-0110,16,23,"Negotiations have been going on for years for expanding the fast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement has been announced ."
AP880324-0193,9,36,"Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches."
AP880324-0193,10,26,"``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac."
AP880324-0193,11,27,"People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West."
AP880324-0193,12,15,"It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination."
AP880324-0193,13,23,"The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it opened Thursday."
AP880324-0193,14,23,"Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding."
AP880324-0193,15,19,"``No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such a sensation as this one today,'' one policeman said."
AP880324-0193,16,21,"``I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade,'' said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger."
AP880324-0193,17,18,"``It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive''."
AP880324-0193,18,35,The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.
AP880324-0193,19,32,"``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with McDonald's."
AP880324-0193,20,20,"``Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market,'' said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the Genex-McDonald's."
AP880324-0193,21,15,``We want to change customs of the local people used to completly different eating habits''.
AP880324-0193,22,18,He said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finished meal will draw a warning.
AP880324-0193,23,10,"Also, smoking is forbidden and alcohol will not be served."
AP880324-0193,24,24,This contrasts sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom of sitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal.
AP880324-0193,25,33,"The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town."
AP880324-0193,26,31,"Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business."
AP880324-0193,27,18,"``However, we will not give up the fight even if we have to lower the prices,'' said Seljami."
AP880324-0193,28,46,"Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, ``We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe''."
AP880324-0193,29,11,McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagship restaurant.
AP880324-0193,30,16,They will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.
AP880324-0193,31,16,"The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour."
AP880324-0193,32,22,"In an effort to keep a high level of services, the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform."
AP880324-0193,33,15,The American corporation plans to open five additional restaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years.
AP880324-0193,34,22,"The next East European McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is to open next month in Budapest, Hungary ."
AP900131-0200,12,31,"Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers,'' ``chizburgers'' and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time."
AP900131-0200,13,27,"The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said."
AP900131-0200,14,27,"The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union."
AP900131-0200,15,18,"The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned."
AP900131-0200,16,24,"``I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me,'' said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant."
AP900131-0200,17,11,"``And it was only 10 rubles for all this,'' she said."
AP900131-0200,18,12,``I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try''.
AP900131-0200,19,39,"Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently."
AP900131-0200,20,28,"The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market."
AP900131-0200,21,33,"Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto."
AP900131-0200,22,30,"The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates."
AP900131-0200,23,12,"The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said."
AP900131-0200,24,20,"Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said."
AP900131-0200,25,15,"Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast, friendly service."
AP900131-0200,26,26,Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard.
AP900131-0200,27,25,"Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales."
AP900131-0200,28,36,"One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink."
AP900131-0200,29,11,"For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger."
AP900131-0200,30,22,"Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ``gamburger''."
AP900131-0200,31,4,They tried them one-handed.
AP900131-0200,32,9,They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents.
AP900131-0200,33,14,One young woman finally squashed her ``Beeg Mak'' to fit her lips around it.
AP900131-0200,34,7,``It tasted great''! a 14-year-old boy said.
AP900131-0200,35,29,"``It's a lot different from a stolovaya,'' he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage."
AP900131-0200,36,49,"Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos."
AP900131-0200,37,18,"Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout ``Good morning, America''! in English and Russian, for an American TV network."
AP900131-0200,38,34,"McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation."
AP900131-0200,39,15,The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.
AP900131-0200,40,38,"McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer."
AP900131-0200,41,32,"One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because ``when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails."
AP900131-0200,42,9,They found you need a permit to buy nails.''
AP901008-0136,10,27,"McDonald's hamburgers, fries and golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine."
AP901008-0136,11,29,"Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in Shenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their first taste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake."
AP901008-0136,12,25,"``I travelled for four hours from a village to get here,'' said Huang Rongti, 70, who has lost most of her teeth because of age."
AP901008-0136,13,9,``You think hamburgers are too challenging for my age''?
AP901008-0136,14,15,"Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected it carefully before taking a bite."
AP901008-0136,15,13,"``It tastes good, I like it,'' she announced before slowly eating the rest."
AP901008-0136,16,23,"The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets."
AP901008-0136,17,11,"It is estimated there are more than 5,000 different Chinese dishes."
AP901008-0136,18,59,"In Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize in some of the more exotic Chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bear paws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish - ``Dragon and Tiger Locked in Battle'' - made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spices, lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals."
AP901008-0136,19,19,"However, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants."
AP901008-0136,20,25,"In Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have built factories, salaries are higher and workers earn an average of $53 a month."
AP901008-0136,21,19,"At the restaurant, a Big Mac costs $1.14, a bag of fries 48 cents and a shake 74 cents."
AP901008-0136,22,22,"Another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened a restaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now has four outlets there."
AP901008-0136,23,9,McDonald's hopes to open a restaurant in Beijing later.
AP901008-0136,24,29,"Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the average Chinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than a convenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems."
AP901008-0136,25,23,"The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building is operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong."
AP901008-0136,26,14,McDonald's Hong Kong is a 50-50 joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.
AP901008-0136,27,19,"It is managed by a Chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son, Chen Yin, who is the restaurant manager."
AP901008-0136,28,16,"The younger Chen returned recently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in Oak Brook, Ill."
AP901008-0136,29,14,Most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now imported from Hong Kong.
AP901008-0136,30,15,But McDonald's executives hope eventually to get their supplies of beef and potatoes from China.
AP901008-0136,31,31,"Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year."
AP901008-0136,32,24,"Last month, when McDonald's advertized for 240 staffers for the restaurant, it received applications from more than 9,000 persons, including college graduates, officials said."
AP901008-0136,33,27,"``I feel I have a better job prospect working here, and it pays better,'' said Henry He, 25, who has a master's degree in garment and textile."
AP901008-0136,34,8,He is an assistant manager at the restaurant.
AP901008-0136,35,11,A waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour.
AP901008-0136,36,40,"A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its ``sweet taste'' - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used in traditional Chinese cooking ."
FT932-5869,7,33,"AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in Russia, Russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers."
FT932-5869,8,33,"Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storey office block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor."
FT932-5869,9,39,McDonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serve Russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russian gratitude.
FT932-5869,10,29,"Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact that McDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow."
FT932-5869,11,29,"He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what he described as 'the most delicious food'."
FT932-5869,12,42,"But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playing the balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life has been tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3 1/2 years ago."
FT932-5869,13,46,"Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment."
FT932-5869,14,24,"'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens to the rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy."
FT932-5869,15,11,We don't have an estimate of how long it will take.

WSJ880412-0015,7,19,Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns.
WSJ880412-0015,8,17,"The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald."
WSJ880412-0015,9,24,"Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were finally going up."
WSJ880412-0015,10,20,McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul.
WSJ880412-0015,11,19,"The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young."
WSJ880412-0015,12,10,McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nations in the region.
WSJ880412-0015,13,30,"But its entry into South Korea, which has Asia's fastest-growing economy, had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms."
WSJ880412-0015,14,14,"South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say."
WSJ880412-0015,15,17,The country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class.
WSJ880412-0015,16,22,"Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance."
WSJ880412-0015,17,25,"Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon."
WSJ880412-0015,18,23,"The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here."
WSJ880412-0015,19,40,"However, the competition is heating up, and there is ""a good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket,"" an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says."
WSJ880412-0015,20,21,"The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chains."
WSJ880412-0015,21,10,"McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr."
WSJ880412-0015,22,8,"Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say."
WSJ880412-0015,23,6,"""We are starting small,"" says Mr."
WSJ880412-0015,24,13,"Ahn. ""We're hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year."
WSJ880412-0015,25,9,"After that, we'd like to open five every year""."
WSJ880412-0015,26,24,"Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere."
WSJ880412-0015,27,27,"The venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspapers, distribution of fliers and word of mouth."
WSJ880412-0015,28,31,"Mr. Sifri says the emphasis will be on developing McDonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea."
WSJ880412-0015,29,9,"Attention will be given to attracting children, he adds."
WSJ880412-0015,30,16,Mr. Ahn says McDonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the Harvard-trained accountant in 1984.
WSJ880412-0015,31,6,"Two years later, McDonald's and Mr."
WSJ880412-0015,32,17,Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form McAhn.
WSJ880412-0015,33,27,McDonald's struggled with the government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner -- the issue was resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products.
WSJ880412-0015,34,22,"The import question ""came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value,"" McDonald's said."
WSJ880412-0015,35,19,"Even McDonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape, since the city regulates the size and color of signs."
WSJ880412-0015,36,13,"""It may be against the law, but we're putting them up anyway,"" Mr."

AP900621-0192,14,33,"Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal Friday."
AP900621-0192,15,28,The envoys from the German states and the four World War II Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the international aspects of German unification.
AP900621-0192,16,26,"Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall."
AP900621-0192,17,21,"With huge sections of the Berlin Wall being ripped down daily, U.S. officials decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie."
AP900621-0192,18,34,"The border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as East Germans tried flee to the West, breaking through East German control stations just 20 yards away from the Allied checkpoint."
AP900621-0192,19,21,"East Germans once manned their side of the checkpoint with emotionless effiency, closely scrutinizing travel documents and creating a palpable tension."
AP900621-0192,20,21,"Thursday night, they merely waved Westerners through their side of the checkpoint, although some tourists demanded their documents be checked ."
AP900622-0080,11,25,Soldiers from three nations locked the doors of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War relic that symbolized a divided world.

AP900622-0080,13,33,"Army band played a stirring song about old Berlin as the rectangular white sentry station, a place East Germans died trying to reach, was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history."
AP900622-0080,14,30,The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the Germanys and the four World War II Allies.
AP900622-0080,15,10,"``For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War,'' U.S."
AP900622-0080,16,19,Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.
AP900622-0080,17,22,"``And now, 29 years after it was built, we meet here today to dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created''."
AP900622-0080,18,29,"Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change."
AP900622-0080,19,31,"Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as an Allied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within six months after the two German states unify, which could come in December."
AP900622-0080,20,28,"The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and distributed later to news media, apparently would also include the Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper."
AP900622-0080,21,15,"The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000 troops in West Berlin."
AP900622-0080,22,20,"Berlin has been split into Soviet, U.S., British and France sectors and West Berlin remains technically separate from West Germany."
AP900622-0080,23,26,The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany's role in world affairs.
AP900622-0080,24,21,"All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and the Germanys by July 2, when the nations merge their economies."
AP900622-0080,25,26,"Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily, and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting."
AP900622-0080,26,26,"A color guard of French, British and American soldiers strode to the building and locked the doors leading to each Allied nation's compartment in the checkpoint."
AP900622-0080,27,12,The giant crane then lifted the box-like building high into the air.
AP900622-0080,28,15,U.S. Army spokesman Sgt. Ed McCarthy said he believes it is destined for a museum.
AP900622-0080,29,27,Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East German checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
AP900622-0080,30,29,"The ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents of the buildings that line Friedrich Street, which had been divided by the Berlin Wall since 1961."
AP900622-0080,31,25,Illa Wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold just 20 yards below the fourth-floor apartment where she has lived for 24 years.
AP900622-0080,32,12,"``I saw eight people shot to death on that street,'' she said."
AP900622-0080,33,13,``I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail.

AP900622-0080,40,30,"East German construction worker Andreas Bratke was working near the wall in January 1986 when he suddenly bolted through the East German checkpoint, down Friedrich Street and through Checkpoint Charlie."
AP900622-0080,41,15,"``I ran as fast as I could,'' he said from his home in West Berlin."
AP900622-0080,42,9,``Checkpoint Charlie is a very important place to me.''
AP900622-0087,11,28,The Soviet Union said today that a united Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
AP900622-0087,12,10,"The United States rejected the proposal, a U.S. official said."
AP900622-0087,13,24,The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany.
AP900622-0087,14,31,"The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period."
AP900622-0087,15,26,"But in exchange, Western and Soviet troops would pull out of the country and Germany's own military strength would be sharply reduced, according to the proposal."
AP900622-0087,16,9,Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S.
AP900622-0087,17,18,"Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states."
AP900622-0087,18,20,"``I am underwhelmed,'' Baker said when asked about the Soviet proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers."
AP900622-0087,19,22,"A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could join NATO."
AP900622-0087,20,11,The official said the other Western ministers expressed the same reservations.
AP900622-0087,21,25,The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed.
AP900622-0087,22,19,West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
AP900622-0087,23,31,Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the German armed forces and ``to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations''.
AP900622-0087,24,11,It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-year period.
AP900622-0087,25,13,Germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying chemmical or nuclear weapons.
AP900622-0087,26,29,"It also said that within six months of unification, all Western troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under military occupation by the United States, France and Britian."
AP900622-0087,27,37,"The four nations would reduce their military forces in the country during a three-year period following unification first by 50 percent, then ``bring them down to a level of token contingents, or completely withdraw them from Germany''."
AP900622-0087,28,29,"There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while a quarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany along with tens of thousands of British and French soldiers."
AP900622-0087,29,29,"Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the exact plans for pulling them out."
AP900622-0087,30,32,"Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four Powers' troops out of ``greater Berlin'' within six months after unification."

AP900623-0009,16,35,"Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane Friday, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history."

AP891106-0072,9,33,"Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term, opposition leaders and political observers said."
AP891106-0072,10,20,A pro-Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the obvious and that her statements were no ``cause for astonishment''.
AP891106-0072,11,35,Mrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interview published Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth.
AP891106-0072,12,19,"``I think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch,'' she told the newspaper."
AP891106-0072,13,10,The Sunday Times of London said in a commentary: ``Mrs.
AP891106-0072,14,6,Thatcher has committed a colossal blunder''.
AP891106-0072,15,22,"``She has given the riders for the Tory succession their starting orders years in advance of the actual race,'' the newspaper said."
AP891106-0072,16,22,"The next election must be held by the summer of 1992, but it is expected Mrs. Thatcher will call it in 1991."
AP891106-0072,17,23,"Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 64 last month, has never previously made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader."
AP891106-0072,18,30,"She was elected in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe, and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she said she planned to ``go on and on''."
AP891106-0072,19,26,"Earlier this year, Mrs. Thatcher overtook Liberal Lord Asquith's 1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become Britain's longest continuously serving prime minister of the 20th century."
AP891106-0072,20,41,"Mrs. Thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief, Nigel Lawson."
AP891106-0072,21,20,"Lord Callaghan, former Labor prime minister whom Mrs. Thatcher defeated in 1979, said her comments had ``considerably weakened her position''."
AP891106-0072,22,32,"If her party wins the next election, it is expected Mrs. Thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her successor to choose a time to call a new election."
AP891106-0072,23,22,"``My guess is that the Tory party will want someone as leader who could take them through the next Parliament,'' Callaghan said."
AP891106-0072,24,41,"If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of Queen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible."
AP891106-0072,25,10,The Sunday Times speculated she would step down by 1994.
AP891106-0072,26,30,"Mrs. Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and her husband, Denis, will be 79 and ``his age may have been a factor in her decision,'' the newspaper said."
AP891106-0072,27,32,"The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try to promote leader Neil Kinnock as ``the occupant-in-waiting of 10 Downing St., who is ready, able and willing to complete a full term''."
AP891106-0072,28,3,Kinnock called Mrs.
AP891106-0072,29,10,Thatcher's comments ``the interview of someone preparing herself for quitting.
AP891106-0072,30,10,"Mentally, Margaret Thatcher is preparing herself for packing her bags''."
AP891106-0072,31,25,"In an editorial today, the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph said Mrs. Thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she would not seek a fifth term."
AP891106-0072,32,21,"``Even were she not to fight a fifth election, Mrs. Thatcher could yet enjoy seven more years in charge,'' it said."
AP891106-0072,33,16,"``By then she would be in her 70s, and her devoted husband a decade older ..."
AP891106-0072,34,20,"Nonetheless, what other politician would be expected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions in seven years time?"
AP891106-0072,35,25,And can it really be a cause for astonishment that Mrs. Thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political activity in her mid-70s and beyond?''
AP901122-0100,13,18,Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's international admirers praised her courage and achievements Thursday after she announced she would resign.
AP901122-0100,14,11,Even her foes tempered scorn with praise for a formidable adversary.
AP901122-0100,15,7,"Said President Bush, ``I will miss her''."
AP901122-0100,16,21,"He called her ``an outstanding ally of the United States,'' adding, ``You always knew where she was and what she believed''."

AP901122-0100,18,3,``Our relations ...
AP901122-0100,19,6,were marked by constructivism and dialogue''.
AP901122-0100,20,15,The reluctance Mrs. Thatcher showed toward increasing European unity was the source of most criticism.
AP901122-0100,21,18,"But in a joyful and unambiguous response, Iraq saw the Persian Gulf crisis as cause of her downfall."
AP901122-0100,22,21,"Bitterness was undisguised in the comment from Argentina's Nicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982 Falklands War with Britain."
AP901122-0100,23,10,"``I can't say that it makes me sad,'' he said."
AP901122-0100,24,34,"``I believe that the extreme positions - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiably extreme - of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war, and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after''."
AP901122-0100,25,18,Socialist President Mario Soares of Portugal singled out ``her systematic opposition to the advances of the European Community''.
AP901122-0100,26,33,"``During her long mandate,'' he said, ``the preoccupations of social justice receded many times before purely development objectives, causing a climate of discontent in British public opinion to which Mrs. Thatcher appeared insensitive''."
AP901122-0100,27,35,But Soares also lauded the British prime minister as a ``determined politician (who) took courageous positions on critical occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in the contemporary history of her country''.
AP901122-0100,28,24,"German Finance Minister Theo Waigel noted, ``Despite her critical position on some questions of European integration, she accomplished a great deal for European politics''."
AP901122-0100,29,29,A neutral letter from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of France told Mrs. Thatcher she had ``marked an important moment in the history of your country and that of Europe''.
AP901122-0100,30,21,Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said growing opposition to her hard line against Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait ``buried Mrs.
AP901122-0100,31,19,Thatcher'' just as the 1956 crisis over Britain's attack on the Suez Canal ruined former Prime Minister Anthony Eden.
AP901122-0100,32,8,Britain stepped in after Egypt nationalized the canal.
AP901122-0100,33,35,"On Thursday, Britain announced it was nearly doubling its troops deployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq, sending 14,000 more soldiers to join the 16,000 already in the region."
AP901122-0100,34,25,"South African President F.W. de Klerk praised Mrs. Thatcher, who opposed sanctions on South Africa, for standing up to world pressure and standing by Pretoria."
AP901122-0100,35,16,``She had faith in South Africa's ability to solve its problems in a democratic way ...
AP901122-0100,36,9,"She had the courage of her convictions,'' he said."
AP901122-0100,37,36,"Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel saidafter hearing of her resignation that Israel ``feels a moment of sorrow because we all know this special personality, Mrs. Thatcher, who did many things and was an outstanding leader''."

AP901122-0100,41,22,"``Whatever the forces arrayed against her, she was always prepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in which she believed''."
AP901122-0100,42,45,"Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said, ``In the many years that she placed such an important stamp on the policies of the United Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher has shown that she does not avoid making difficult decisions that she deems to be in the nation's interest."
AP901122-0100,43,9,"This, too, is such a decision which deserves respect''."
AP901122-0100,44,15,"Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now a legislator in the European Parliament, said Mrs."
AP901122-0100,45,8,Thatcher's decision to quit was ``dignified and courageous''.
AP901122-0100,46,19,``Margaret Thatcher will be seen with Winston Churchill as the greatest British prime minister of the last 50 years.
AP901122-0100,47,8,The curtain has fallen on the Iron Lady.

AP901122-0100,54,14,"``Margaret Thatcher's resoluteness played a key role in ending the Cold War,'' he said."
AP901122-0100,55,13,``She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meant business.
AP901122-0100,56,42,Her deep and abiding dedication to the principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that Margaret Thatcher would never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to live in freedom.''
AP901123-0002,11,29,"For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies."
AP901123-0002,12,19,"Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in 1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya."
AP901123-0002,13,18,"In the Persian Gulf crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the Middle East."
AP901123-0002,14,19,"``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush said upon hearing of her decision to resign."
AP901123-0002,15,13,"``She has always been an outstanding ally of the United States,'' he said."
AP901123-0002,16,4,``I will miss her''.
AP901123-0002,17,27,There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that seemed out of step with the times.
AP901123-0002,18,15,Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of the skeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.
AP901123-0002,19,7,They shared rocky relations with organized labor.
AP901123-0002,20,14,"Reagan successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a devastating blow to labor."
AP901123-0002,21,5,"She, too, smashed restive unions."
AP901123-0002,22,17,"On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing than Reagan - certainly more so than Bush."
AP901123-0002,23,14,Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the British prime minister.
AP901123-0002,24,11,They were ideological soulmates and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
AP901123-0002,25,9,"At international gatherings, they usually were side by side."
AP901123-0002,26,40,"Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with ``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street''."
AP901123-0002,27,21,"She later wrote him a ``Dear Ron'' letter in which she praised him as ``a great president, one of the greatest''."
AP901123-0002,28,10,"Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union."
AP901123-0002,29,32,Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed military readiness - even though she was the first to recognize Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
AP901123-0002,30,17,Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength.
AP901123-0002,31,27,She was a big backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to disarmament.
AP901123-0002,32,23,"When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice between two allies."
AP901123-0002,33,4,Ronnie sided with Margaret.

AP901123-0002,35,27,Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publicly last year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese and Cambodian ``boat people'' who were fleeing their countries to Hong Kong.
AP901123-0002,36,12,"Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around the globe."
AP901123-0002,37,11,Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.
AP901123-0002,38,21,The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
AP901123-0002,39,23,She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
AP901123-0002,40,21,"Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the ``special relationship'' between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a ``steady keel''."
AP901123-0002,41,8,"Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty."
AP901123-0002,42,27,"For awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and appeared uncertain how to respond."
AP901123-0002,43,13,"Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the Soviet leader."
AP901123-0002,44,7,Now they seem almost best of friends.
AP901123-0002,45,26,"On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible."
AP901123-0002,46,5,"Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher."
AP901123-0002,47,22,"She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the West would have to use military force to dislodge him."
AP901123-0002,48,18,"She called Saddam ``a loser,'' and the state-controlled Iraqi news agency replied that she was an ``old hag''."
AP901123-0002,49,4,"Now, she is leaving."
AP901123-0002,50,19,No one suspects that Britain's new leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
AP901123-0002,51,25,"Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher ."
AP901123-0062,12,31,"Former President Reagan thanked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset."
AP901123-0062,13,26,"``Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity,'' Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement."
AP901123-0062,14,17,"``I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support, and her loyal friendship,'' Reagan said."
AP901123-0062,15,20,"Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister in 1986."
AP901123-0062,16,24,Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed a formidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutual regard.
AP901123-0062,17,14,They often stood side-by-side at international gatherings and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
AP901123-0062,18,40,"Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with ``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street''."
AP901123-0062,19,35,"Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friends at his Bel-Air home, called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a ``selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best interests of her country''."
AP901123-0062,20,9,The former chief executive was always grateful to Mrs.
AP901123-0062,21,14,Thatcher's support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs during his own eight-year tenure.
AP901123-0062,22,31,"In 1986, when the U.S. bombing of Libya was criticized by world powers, Mrs. Thatcher was the only ally who supported Reagan and allowed the bombers to fly from British bases."
AP901123-0062,23,18,"When Britain fought Argentina for the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to choose between two allies."
AP901123-0062,24,5,Reagan sided with Mrs. Thatcher.
AP901123-0062,25,25,"She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagon buildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies."
AP901123-0062,26,27,"Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, but were quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the Cold War thawed."

AP901123-0062,33,16,Average earnings were up by nearly one-third and more Britons owned their homes during her tenor.

AP901126-0053,14,21,"Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister."
AP901126-0053,15,14,"``She has broken the mold once and forever,'' Ms. Nicholson said in an interview."
AP901126-0053,16,21,"Mrs. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before studying law, said she viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman."

AP901126-0053,18,10,``What has it ever done for me''? she once asked.
AP901126-0053,19,23,"Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to get involved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder."
AP901126-0053,20,35,"Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in a Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983."

AP901126-0053,31,13,Britain has a higher proportion of working women than other European Community countries.
AP901126-0053,32,36,"Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues, she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions for workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; and legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits."
AP901126-0053,33,17,"But as prime minister, she angered feminists by often emphasizing women's traditional roles of homemakers and care-givers."

LA112090-0165,9,54,"A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979 ."

LA112390-0008,11,10,"In the State Department, too, it came as a shock."
LA112390-0008,12,22,Americans who had come to take Thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for her passing .
LA112390-0008,13,24,Thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday.
LA112390-0008,14,11,The feeling everywhere was that Thatcher always stuck to her word.
LA112390-0008,15,3,So no problem.
LA112390-0008,16,4,Pass the turkey .
LA112390-0008,17,37,"Thatcher's friends all over the world had reckoned without the British Conservative Party, which had looked at the opinion polls, the bad economic news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election."
LA112390-0008,18,32,"They had reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant Michael Heseltine among the middle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects if the unpredictable ""Tarzan"" came to power ."
LA112390-0008,19,52,"It was an extraordinary scene in the palace of Westminster on Wednesday night as one by one her own Cabinet members trooped sheepishly into Thatcher's office and told her, in their chosen code, that they ""couldn't support her over the weekend"" in the second round of secret balloting on the party's leadership."
LA112390-0008,20,14,"Therefore, if Heseltine was to be beaten, it had to be by someone else."
LA112390-0008,21,20,"After ""sleeping on it,"" as one of her closest advisers put it, Thatcher reluctantly concluded that she had to go."
LA112390-0008,22,37,Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British and American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader Neville Chamberlain .
LA112390-0008,23,14,"When George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in his praise."
LA112390-0008,24,9,"Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow."

LA112390-0008,29,14,"At the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, the President deliberately sought Thatcher's analysis."
LA112390-0008,30,29,"It was her assessment of the threat to international security posed by Iraqi aggression that, according to British and American sources, set the moral framework for Operation Desert Shield."
LA112390-0008,31,33,"The pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about Iraq on Bush's behalf in the Colorado mountain garden of the U.S. ambassador to Britain, Henry Catto; that marked the public turning point."

LA112390-0008,33,20,"And he was able to defer to her without embarrassment, seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first ."
LA112390-0008,34,15,Bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential successors.

LA112390-0008,42,26,They shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back -- and she helped persuade him that Mikhail Gorbachev was a man who could be trusted.

AP890420-0176,10,35,The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to blow up.
AP890420-0176,11,22,"None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before the explosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said."
AP890420-0176,12,21,They discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hot debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.
AP890420-0176,13,33,"The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri."
AP890420-0176,14,48,"The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600 crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead."
AP890420-0176,15,23,"At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announced President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the victims in Norfolk."
AP890420-0176,16,25,"He said the president had heard of the service and told his staff ``if it could be fitted in, he wanted to be there ..."
AP890420-0176,17,5,wants to be a part''.
AP890420-0176,18,23,The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico as the Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of naval training.
AP890420-0176,19,34,A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captain both said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have been triggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gun turret.
AP890420-0176,20,23,"But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office, said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired."
AP890420-0176,21,35,"Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a training exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been from the No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded."
AP890420-0176,22,20,"No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever."
AP890420-0176,23,56,"Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the exact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since 1977, but two officers _ Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, and Capt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain _ said a possible explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited new charges."
AP890420-0176,24,14,"But Seaquist stressed, ``We simply do not know what caused that powder to go''."
AP890420-0176,25,36,Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and the order had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load and prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.
AP890420-0176,26,26,"``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back to Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels."
AP890420-0176,27,21,"The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to unload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware."
AP890420-0176,28,19,"Navy investigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it is expected to arrive Sunday or Monday."
AP890420-0176,29,19,"Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at the Delaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary."

AP890420-0176,32,17,"The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials in Norfolk received the list of the dead."
AP890420-0176,33,23,"``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,'' said Cmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base."
AP890420-0176,34,8,Five men had families in the Norfolk area.
AP890420-0176,35,27,"The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, who was on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, ``The fire and explosion was instantaneous''."
AP890420-0176,36,27,"Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun house at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition magazines below it."
AP890420-0176,37,16,Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at the base of the turret.
AP890420-0176,38,14,A dozen crew members suffered minor injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion.
AP890420-0176,39,12,"They were treated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman."
AP890420-0176,40,37,"At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestions that the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War II leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of the Reagan administration."
AP890420-0176,41,26,"Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insure that procedures were checked ``to be sure that safety is at the highest point ..."
AP890420-0176,42,27,but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that makes a useful platform obsolete''.
AP890420-0176,43,17,"Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey, began the board of inquiry's investigation."
AP890420-0176,44,12,Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed.
AP890420-0176,45,12,"Seaquist told reporters, ``It seems from the reports that those powders exploded''."
AP890420-0176,46,21,"He referred to the six 110-pound sacks of powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell."
AP890420-0176,47,20,Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from the breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually.
AP890420-0176,48,21,"Each gun has a one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds of pressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel."
AP890420-0176,49,41,"The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch from Las Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded."
AP890420-0176,50,44,"Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that ``cooks off'' _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round."
AP890420-0176,51,14,"``The first thing that comes to mind is something like a cook-off,'' said Hanley."
AP890420-0176,52,9,``It could have been a bag or a projectile.
AP890420-0176,53,5,We just don't know yet''.
AP890420-0176,54,31,"None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which saw service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has ever sustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said."
AP890420-0176,55,41,"Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was struck by a Spanish freighter."
AP890420-0176,56,29,"Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the current Navy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class are the largest warships in the world ."
AP890421-0013,9,39,Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones.
AP890421-0013,10,43,"Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast that ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico."
AP890421-0013,11,26,"Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday, their task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling gun housing where the explosion occurred."
AP890421-0013,12,17,Eleven men escaped from powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the turret.

AP890421-0013,17,13,Navy honor guards carried the coffins off a camouflaged C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
AP890421-0013,18,33,"The bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa while it was anchored offshore from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico, and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home."

AP890421-0013,24,19,"The dead included one officer, Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch, 24, of Las Cruces, N.M., and 46 enlisted men."
AP890421-0013,25,14,"Most victims were single and from 18 to 22 years old, said Navy officials."
AP890421-0013,26,11,A memorial service will be held Monday on the Norfolk base.
AP890421-0013,27,22,"Adm. Jerome Johnson, the commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet who was aboard the Iowa, said ``the fire and explosion was instantaneous''."
AP890421-0013,28,10,Navy officials aboard the Iowa had scheduled firing 22 rounds.
AP890421-0013,29,32,"Four rounds were fired from the No. 1 turret and immediately after the commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun in the No. 2 turret, the explosion occurred."

AP890421-0062,11,33,"The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say."
AP890421-0062,12,5,``They're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous.
AP890421-0062,13,19,"They all ought to be eliminated,'' retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday."
AP890421-0062,14,21,``I don't know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships''.
AP890421-0062,15,34,"But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice."
AP890421-0062,16,3,``This gun ...
AP890421-0062,17,8,remains the finest naval gun in the world.
AP890421-0062,18,26,"It was the pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-line system,'' said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa until last May."
AP890421-0062,19,22,The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel.
AP890421-0062,20,28,It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the Civil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package.
AP890421-0062,21,32,"In the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder _ six 110-pound bags _ is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a speed of 2,500 feet per second."
AP890421-0062,22,6,An electric spark ignites the powder.
AP890421-0062,23,27,"The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel."
AP890421-0062,24,33,"Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a ``blowback,'' which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed."
AP890421-0062,25,9,"In newer guns, powder is packed in metal containers."
AP890421-0062,26,12,"Missiles, the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, have integrated propellants."
AP890421-0062,27,39,"Capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, a private think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder."
AP890421-0062,28,3,``It wasn't unexpected.
AP890421-0062,29,4,It wasn't a surprise.
AP890421-0062,30,4,This is dangerous technology.
AP890421-0062,31,4,"It's archaic,'' Bush said."
AP890421-0062,32,13,``These are the only guns in the Navy that still used bagged powder''.
AP890421-0062,33,21,The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place.
AP890421-0062,34,31,"The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri."
AP890421-0062,35,19,"In a larger sense, critics say the battleships themselves, once the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose."
AP890421-0062,36,13,"Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons are vulnerable to submarine and missile attack."
AP890421-0062,37,22,The 20-mile range of the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances.
AP890421-0062,38,14,"``We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,'' Bush said."
AP890421-0062,39,15,Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and were intended to fight other ships.
AP890421-0062,40,20,"The Iowa, first launched in 1942, was the first of an entire class of U.S. battlewagons built to conquer Japan."
AP890421-0062,41,30,"It supported Marine amphibious landings and shelled shore targets, but the aircraft carrier emerged as the Navy's top weapon because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each other."
AP890421-0062,42,6,The Iowa also fought off Korea.
AP890421-0062,43,20,The Iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs in the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago.
AP890421-0062,44,12,"They were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoon missiles."
AP890421-0062,45,22,"One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian and Druze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in 1983."
AP890421-0062,46,19,"But the 16-inch guns often missed their targets, which the Navy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II."
AP890421-0062,47,16,"``There was no military need to return these ships to active duty,'' said the CDI's LaRocque."
AP890421-0062,48,18,"``Their only military utility is to bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacy is over.''"
AP890421-0186,9,30,The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed 47 sailors.
AP890421-0186,10,32,"Ens. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy would not release the exact position of the ship, which was expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday."
AP890421-0186,11,43,The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
AP890421-0186,12,18,"Navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded gun barrels in the turret, the newspaper reported."
AP890421-0186,13,31,"The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said."
AP890421-0186,14,27,"After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they could explode, the newspaper said."
AP890421-0186,15,35,"Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast in one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so complete."
AP890421-0186,16,29,"The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool off the turret before anyone could enter it."
AP890421-0186,17,36,"During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said Lt."
AP890421-0186,18,6,"Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman."
AP890421-0186,19,15,He said the investigators had not decided whether to release the tape to the public.

AP890421-0186,23,6,President George Bush is to attend.
AP890421-0186,24,25,"Johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power, and repeated the Navy's daily report that the ship is seaworthy and in no danger."
AP890421-0186,25,11,"The 887-foot, 58,000-ton battleship has armor up to 17 inches thick."
AP890421-0186,26,17,Navy officials have said that the explosion in the No. 2 gun turret damaged only the turret.
AP890421-0186,27,20,The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion.
AP890421-0186,28,14,The explosion occurred during open seas gun practice 300 miles north of Puerto Rico.
AP890421-0186,29,26,"The Pentagon said the blast ripped through the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not been fired prior to the explosion."
AP890421-0186,30,16,The Pentagon has ordered that no 16-inch gun will be fired until the investigation is complete.
AP890421-0186,31,20,"Ships with those guns _ the battleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin _ were built during World War II."
AP890421-0186,32,12,Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded and dangerous .
AP890422-0035,10,29,Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47 sailors who died on the USS Iowa as victims of a tragedy that ``reaches into little towns all over the country''.

AP890423-0090,26,36,"The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ``bloomers'' that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse."

AP890424-0026,13,21,"``They're moving as quickly as they can,'' Lt. Mescus said, but added, ``They want to be thorough and that takes time''."
AP890424-0026,14,13,Dooley said the investigation would be ``fairly complex'' because there were no witnesses.
AP890424-0026,15,21,"There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said."
AP890424-0026,16,33,"Dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret."

AP890425-0013,24,33,As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.
AP890425-0013,25,13,"Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's Mate David Finn, 38."
AP890425-0013,26,8,"``It was very important to them,'' Finn said."
AP890425-0013,27,39,"The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500 crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates."
AP890425-0013,28,15,Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2.
AP890425-0013,29,26,"``I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause,'' he said."

AP880625-0142,7,31,"President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday."
AP880625-0142,8,33,"The Manila Bulletin and The Manila Chronicle quoted Mrs. Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro Benigno, as saying that Mrs. Aquino made the assurance to two Swiss lawyers before she visited Switzerland earlier this month."
AP880625-0142,9,25,"The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos, Aquino's ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino will allow him to return."
AP880625-0142,10,13,"Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines, citing security reasons."
AP880625-0142,11,6,Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii.
AP880625-0142,12,25,"Mrs. Aquino's government has said it will file criminal charges against Marcos, whom it has accused of stealing up to $10 billion in government funds."
AP880625-0142,13,18,But the government has not done so because of Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.
AP880625-0142,14,8,Philippine law does not allow trial in absentia.
AP880625-0142,15,20,Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos and his family allegedly placed in Swiss bank accounts.
AP880625-0142,16,23,Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was toppled by the civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.
AP880625-0142,17,34,The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the Philippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos' lawyers and Swiss banks.
AP880625-0142,18,32,"The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over ``unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him,'' Benigno was quoted as saying."

AP880625-0142,20,33,Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
AP880625-0142,21,25,She said later she would abide by any court decision if Marcos' lawyers in the Philippines raised the matter of his return to the courts.

AP890519-0060,14,16,"Hospital officials said the 71-year-old former Philippine leader was suffering from renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure."
AP890519-0060,15,29,"In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left the hospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland."

AP890519-0060,20,13,"``This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for the country,'' Imelda said."
AP890519-0060,21,14,``I'd like to ask our people to pray that Marcos may continue to live''.
AP890519-0060,22,26,Mrs. Aquino told reporters earlier that she was sorry to hear that Marcos' condition had deteriorated ``and I pray that he will be able to recover''.
AP890519-0060,23,5,``I regret to inform Mrs.
AP890519-0060,24,23,"Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr."
AP890519-0060,25,21,"Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos,'' Mrs. Aquino said."
AP890519-0060,26,32,"``I have already said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents,'' she added."
AP890519-0060,27,19,Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
AP890519-0060,28,15,"Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to 1,084.53 from Thursday's close of 1,102.97."
AP890519-0060,29,13,Traders said rumors of Marcos' death triggered a selling wave shortly before noon.

AP890519-0060,31,17,Marcos planned to make one last appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to return home.
AP890519-0060,32,29,"Rafael Ileto, Mrs. Aquino's national security advisor, said granting such a request was still an option but, ``I doubt very much that it will be one of the solutions''."
AP890519-0060,33,29,"Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, said Marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers ``can cause disruptions of normal functions''."
AP890519-0060,34,26,"Ileto, a retired vice chief of staff and former Defense Minister, said the 160,000-member armed forces was capable of quelling any unrest by Marcos supporters ."
AP890519-0117,10,33,President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last appeal'' from his wife.

AP890519-0117,14,29,"But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and the Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former president's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return."
AP890519-0117,15,22,Marcos has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
AP890519-0117,16,13,``I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr.
AP890519-0117,17,18,"Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latest critical illness,'' Mrs. Aquino said."
AP890519-0117,18,15,``I regret very much it is not possible for us to allow him to return''.
AP890519-0117,19,31,"She said she has ``said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents''."
AP890519-0117,20,17,"Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts, has cited national security in refusing previous requests."
AP890519-0117,21,10,"In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs."

AP890519-0117,24,2,Marcos. Mrs.

AP890519-0117,27,2,Marcos said.
AP890519-0117,28,7,``This is what's best for the country''.
AP890519-0117,29,10,Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: ``I regret to inform Mrs.

AP890710-0170,7,20,President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
AP890710-0170,8,27,"Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation European tour, met with West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other officials."
AP890710-0170,9,31,"Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland."
AP890710-0170,10,39,"``We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor,'' she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade."
AP890710-0170,11,28,"``We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars,'' she said."
AP890710-0170,12,35,Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
AP890710-0170,13,33,"She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988."
AP890710-0170,14,23,"``What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,'' Mrs. Aquino said."
AP890710-0170,15,23,"During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs. Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West Germany and the Philippines."
AP890710-0170,16,36,"Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock out trade with other countries."
AP890710-0170,17,21,"Mrs. Aquino, who arrived in West Germany on Sunday, will meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday before departing for Paris."

AP900408-0059,11,28,The resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision.
AP900408-0059,12,25,"The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation of Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, 35, whose nomination was opposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party."
AP900408-0059,13,31,Handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which Mrs. Aquino has been criticized: lack of clear priorities; tactical blundering; and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy.
AP900408-0059,14,41,"It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric, Mrs. Aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 ``people power'' uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos."
AP900408-0059,15,18,"``The sincerity of Corazon Aquino is being seriously questioned,'' wrote columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in the Philippine Daily Inquirer."
AP900408-0059,16,10,"Land reform, ``the centerpiece program of her administration, is dead''."
AP900408-0059,17,27,"Abad's troubles began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park."
AP900408-0059,18,27,"Although the deal was approved by the National Development Corp., Abad, a former congressman, said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program."
AP900408-0059,19,22,The Department of Trade and Industry said the Marubeni deal was crucial to attracting much-needed foreign investment for the government's industrialization program.
AP900408-0059,20,32,"But the Department of Agrarian Reform said if the Cavite land was exempted, hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title."
AP900408-0059,21,20,The presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement.
AP900408-0059,22,12,Abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders from Mrs. Aquino.
AP900408-0059,23,23,"Abad's firm stand, however, alarmed landowners in Congress, who floated rumors in the press that the Agrarian Reform Department was riddled with Communists."
AP900408-0059,24,27,Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party blocked Abad's confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned.
AP900408-0059,25,13,"Despite the party's ``victory,'' poltical damage to it and Mrs. Aquino was considerable."
AP900408-0059,26,31,"The Manila press transformed Abad into a folk hero, depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, dubbed ``Landlord-Dominated Party''."
AP900408-0059,27,6,"``Worry not about Abad's destiny, Mrs."
AP900408-0059,28,9,"President,'' wrote columnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle."
AP900408-0059,29,13,``Worry about yours and how you blew the last chance'' for liberal support.
AP900408-0059,30,14,"Mrs. Aquino pledged publicly to work for Abad's confirmation, but her lobbying appeared ineffectual."
AP900408-0059,31,20,"Abad's strongest opponents included politicians who consistently support Mrs. Aquino, leading to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed."
AP900408-0059,32,16,"Abad's opponents included her younger brother, Rep. Jose ``Peping'' Cojuangco, who wields considerable influence in government."
AP900408-0059,33,18,"``There is no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping,'' said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity."
AP900408-0059,34,7,Mrs. Aquino comes from a landlord family.
AP900408-0059,35,16,"She and her brothers and sisters are partners in a 14,500-acre sugar plantation in Tarlac province."
AP900408-0059,36,19,"Rather than break up the estate, they used a legal option and created a ``profit-sharing'' plan for the tenants."
AP900408-0059,37,24,"The Abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the agrarian reform program, once touted as the ``centerpiece'' of the administration."
AP900408-0059,38,20,"Last year, Agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land."
AP900408-0059,39,27,"His successor, Miriam Defensor Santiago, was repeatedly rejected by the Commission on Appointments, only to be reappointed until Mrs. Aquino replaced her with Abad on Dec. 31."
AP900408-0059,40,7,No reason for the change was given.
AP900408-0059,41,21,But Mrs. Santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs. Aquino during a coup attempt in early December.
AP900408-0059,42,23,Agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions of peasants.
AP900408-0059,43,13,The program was advertised as essential in curbing the 21-year-old rural-based Marxist insurgency.
AP900408-0059,44,14,Mrs. Aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but left details to Congress.
AP900408-0059,45,20,"The final bill contained so many pro-landlord loopholes that several of its original sponsors, including Abad, voted against it ."
AP900408-0059,46,2,EDITOR'S NOTE
AP900408-0059,47,15,Robert H. Reid has been the AP bureau chief in Manila since September 1986 .
AP900829-0044,9,27,President Corazon Aquino today reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts.
AP900829-0044,10,19,"Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks, including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile."
AP900829-0044,11,8,Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions.
AP900829-0044,12,28,"Although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts."
AP900829-0044,13,14,The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion to establish a Marxist state.
AP900829-0044,14,9,The last cease-fire with them collapsed in early 1987.

AP900829-0044,17,27,"Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986."
AP900829-0044,18,25,Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrile are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of Cabinet members.
AP900829-0044,19,28,Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused any cease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 when the Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-day truce.
AP900829-0044,20,18,"Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino."
AP900829-0044,21,25,Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him.

LA101390-0087,10,31,The quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the Philippines' second-largest island leaves President Corazon Aquino's beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead .
LA101390-0087,11,42,Analysts here say Aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army Col. Alexander Noble on the north coast of Mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government is indecisive and inept .
LA101390-0087,12,35,"And despite widespread fears that the Oct. 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to Aquino, leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move ."
LA101390-0087,13,13,"""It was the coup attempt that didn't catch fire,"" one Western diplomat said."
LA101390-0087,14,9,"""It sort of fizzled before anything could happen"" ."
LA101390-0087,15,14,But he and other diplomats see little benefit for Aquino's battered image overseas .
LA101390-0087,16,12,"""The international consequence is people saying, 'Yet another revolt in the Philippines'."
LA101390-0087,17,10,"It's like she's under a perpetual onslaught,"" he said ."
LA101390-0087,18,61,"Moreover, questions linger as to how Noble and about 350 rebel troops so easily evaded a much-publicized military manhunt to drive 140 miles from their mountain sanctuary, pass unhindered through at least 10 military checkpoints and seize two military camps, including the command post of the general who had been ordered to capture him -- all without firing a shot ."
LA101390-0087,19,27,"Noble, once chief of staff of Aquino's own security detail, quickly linked up with Reuben Canoy, a local politician who heads the so-called Mindanao Independence Movement ."
LA101390-0087,20,29,The resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th Century -- though Canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of U.S.

LA101390-0087,22,12,"""The whole thing was kind of a farce,"" one Asian diplomat said."
LA101390-0087,23,5,"""Only in the Philippines"" ."
LA101390-0087,24,43,"Noble, best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap, quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after two World War II-vintage T-28 planes, called Tora Toras here, bombed and strafed one of the camps."
LA101390-0087,25,13,"One plane later crashed and the pilot drowned, the revolt's only fatality ."
LA101390-0087,26,17,Aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and aborted military mutinies.
LA101390-0087,27,23,"Most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on for days, as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other soldiers."
LA101390-0087,28,16,"In one case, mutineers were ordered to do push-ups and attend Bible class as punishment ."
LA101390-0087,29,22,"""This time was a different government response altogether, which Noble clearly had underestimated,"" said University of the Philippines political scientist Alex Magno."
LA101390-0087,30,11,"""He expected another standoff and hoped for other camps to defect."
LA101390-0087,31,5,"He got bombed instead"" ."
LA101390-0087,32,20,"After the revolt, the government toughened its anti-coup law, boosting the maximum penalty from 12 years to life in prison."
LA101390-0087,33,18,"Aquino's spokesman, Tomas Gomez III, urged other rebel leaders to take ""the honorable way out"" -- suicide ."
LA101390-0087,34,35,"Ironically, Noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last December's coup attempt in Manila, which left more than 100 people dead ."
LA101390-0087,35,32,"After 332 witnesses, 226 sworn statements and 4,100 documents, the so-called Davide Commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue -- but unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future ."
LA101390-0087,36,28,"Commission member Delfin Lazaro estimated that 70 officers involved in last December's coup attempt, which came closest to toppling Aquino, are still at large and still plotting ."

FT931-2858,8,30,"It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago."
FT931-2858,9,17,"Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday."
FT931-2858,10,23,"But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23."
FT931-2858,11,44,"All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment."
FT931-2858,12,18,"Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month."
FT931-2858,13,19,"He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group."
FT931-2858,14,28,"He did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget speculation."
FT931-2858,15,20,"To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains."
FT931-2858,16,28,He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
FT931-2858,17,19,"Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later."
FT931-2858,18,9,"Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare."
FT931-2858,19,38,"While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year."
FT931-2858,20,30,"The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low."
FT931-2858,21,38,"Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs)."
FT931-2858,22,20,The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock.
FT931-2858,23,23,"At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210."
FT931-2858,24,24,"The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27."

FT931-3664,9,6,Who can stop this happening again'?
FT931-3664,10,11,Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
FT931-3664,11,20,They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January.
FT931-3664,12,24,"Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya."
FT931-3664,13,12,"The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles."
FT931-3664,14,22,"Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money."
FT931-3664,15,24,"The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists."
FT931-3664,16,23,But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital.
FT931-3664,17,9,Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports.
FT931-3664,18,17,"Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy."
FT931-3664,19,26,The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.
FT931-3664,20,54,"But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay."
FT931-3664,21,26,"If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan."
FT931-3664,22,5,The implications would be vast.
FT931-3664,23,15,Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
FT931-3664,24,25,Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country.
FT931-3664,25,17,I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country'.
FT931-3664,26,14,"There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to Pakistan."
FT931-3664,27,21,"Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries."
FT931-3664,28,13,India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.
FT931-3664,29,18,"For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm."
FT931-3664,30,15,"Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building."
FT931-3664,31,9,Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them.
FT931-3664,32,23,"At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday."
FT931-3664,33,14,Others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India.
FT931-3664,34,27,The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year.
FT931-3664,35,23,Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.
FT931-3664,36,15,They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots.
FT931-3664,37,27,Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts.
FT931-3664,38,27,"But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers ."

FT931-3764,6,31,"THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand."
FT931-3764,7,15,"The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart."
FT931-3764,8,8,All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon.
FT931-3764,9,22,"Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport."
FT931-3764,10,33,"The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India."
FT931-3764,11,29,"More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6."
FT931-3764,12,34,The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
FT931-3764,13,29,"One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which most victims were Moslems."
FT931-3764,14,18,National and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence.
FT931-3764,15,15,Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'.
FT931-3764,16,29,"Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert."
FT931-3764,17,23,He said: 'It is aimed at disrupting the economy and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the target'.
FT931-3764,18,18,"Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy'."
FT931-3764,19,23,The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
FT931-3764,20,12,"However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy."
FT931-3764,21,30,The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
FT931-3764,22,35,"At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street."
FT931-3764,23,9,Some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape.

FT931-4176,7,33,"A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books."
FT931-4176,8,27,"The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules, including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments."
FT931-4176,9,16,It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration.
FT931-4176,10,19,"The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made out of context and blown out of proportion'."
FT931-4176,11,49,"The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago."
FT931-4176,12,6,Yesterday the index closed at 2330.
FT931-4176,13,28,"Foreign investors, who are being wooed by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the latest allegations of poor management at the exchange."
FT931-4176,14,46,"In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m)."
FT931-4176,15,27,Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the report were off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for which margin payments were not required.
FT931-4176,16,16,"Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions."
FT931-4176,17,12,Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its building.
FT931-4176,18,24,This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago.
FT931-4176,19,17,"It was established by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial reform."
FT931-4176,20,12,Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their needs.
FT931-4176,21,22,They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations.
FT931-4176,22,21,But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech.
FT931-4176,23,39,"Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market scandal in which banks, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a combined gross total of Rs40bn ."

AP881106-0062,10,33,"Television watchers of the 19th annual New York City Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of the leaders, but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands of runners for a familar face."
AP881106-0062,11,36,"The winner in the field of 23,478 _ largest ever for a marathon _ was Steve Jones of Wales, who finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds, only seven seconds off the course record."
AP881106-0062,12,15,Grete Waitz of Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time in 2:28:07.
AP881106-0062,13,14,Marybeth Torpe was hoping another runner would run fast _ her boyfriend Tony Giannelli.
AP881106-0062,14,31,She and several others had staked out the corner table at a restaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as they romped off the Queensboro Bridge.
AP881106-0062,15,13,Their hopes on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkers native ran.
AP881106-0062,16,8,``We have to leave this table by 12:30.
AP881106-0062,17,12,"The manager's kicking us out,'' said one of Giannelli's friends, Pete Koogan."
AP881106-0062,18,8,"Torpe was eager for Giannelli to finish, too."
AP881106-0062,19,20,"``I'm going to ask him to marry me today,'' she said, holding up the rose she planned to give him."
AP881106-0062,20,18,"Crowds cheered for the those in the lead packs and the also-rans on the warm, sunny autumn day."
AP881106-0062,21,7,"Lynne Avery, a sophomore at Morristown (N.J)."
AP881106-0062,22,20,"High School, waited on First Avenue near 60th Street hoping to catch a glimpse of her English teacher, Robert Paciorkowski."
AP881106-0062,23,10,But she was not taking any chances on missing him.
AP881106-0062,24,27,"``Mr. Paciorkowski told us if he saw a television camera, he'd wave to us,'' Avery said _ as she held a small portable television in her hand."
AP881106-0062,25,25,"All along the marathon route, volunteers handed drinks to runners, but Rick Fairlamb of Glen Rock, N.J., had prepared a special elixir of carrot juice."
AP881106-0062,26,26,He handed them out to the 50 or so runners in the ``Natural Living'' running club who passed his table at 61st Street and First Avenue.
AP881106-0062,27,16,``Last night I went into Brooklyn and got 500 pounds of carrots from a food co-op.

AP881106-0062,32,8,"``They're both so courteous, full of good sportsmanship."
AP881106-0062,33,5,They always help other runners.

AP881106-0062,35,7,``And that's the way it should be''.
AP881106-0062,36,31,"In Washington, D.C., more than 13,000 people from 23 countries and 49 states ran the Marine Corps Marathon, which offers no prize money and prides itself on being the ``people's race''."
AP881106-0062,37,31,"Jim Hage, a lawyer from Lanham, Md., who had never won a major marathon, pulled away from two-time champion Brad Ingram in the last half mile to win in 2:21:58 ."
FT923-8766,6,23,"TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held."
FT923-8766,7,8,It is also without doubt the most gruelling.
FT923-8766,8,29,"Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run."
FT923-8766,9,8,There are lots of figures to show why.
FT923-8766,10,23,"It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C."
FT923-8766,11,23,"Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C."
FT923-8766,12,16,"More debilitating still, relative humidity in Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent."
FT923-8766,13,16,"With more than 10 kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run."
FT923-8766,14,49,"The last 4.6km, which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of the hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, and includes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep 'red' run."
FT923-8766,15,16,But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary difficulty of tomorrow's race.
FT923-8766,16,29,"Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, I watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions."
FT923-8766,17,20,"Never in any event voluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such signs of physical and mental distress."
FT923-8766,18,35,"The race was won by the Unified Team's Valentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in Los Angeles and Seoul."
FT923-8766,19,38,"After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, came in eight seconds later, they had the energy - between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile for the cameras."
FT923-8766,20,20,"It was a different story in the 'mixed zone,' the area under the stadium where athletes recover after their events."
FT923-8766,21,38,As runner after runner stumbled and limped into the room - several were brought in senseless on stretchers - the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued after weeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.
FT923-8766,22,29,"As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face, Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm."
FT923-8766,23,22,"Several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as water was poured over them; others stood hunched over, grasping their abdomens."
FT923-8766,24,15,"If anyone moved at all, it was with agonised faces and the slowest of hobbles."
FT923-8766,25,21,These are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm for marathon running or for the ideals of Olympic competition.
FT923-8766,26,17,"Chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, was on hand to witness the suffering, and was incensed."
FT923-8766,27,19,"Male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said."
FT923-8766,28,34,"In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism."
FT923-8766,29,46,"'To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing in the morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter."
FT923-8766,30,27,"I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and 1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event."
FT923-8766,31,28,"He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about tomorrow's slog."
FT923-8766,32,16,"Like almost all the athletes running tomorrow, Brace is a professional runner who specialises in marathons."
FT923-8766,33,9,"He takes an objective, long-term view of his profession."
FT923-8766,34,21,"As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations, and requires business management as well as physical ability."
FT923-8766,35,26,"The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the New York, Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category."
FT923-8766,36,22,"But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating, and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape."
FT923-8766,37,17,"With their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runners normally only run two marathons a year."
FT923-8766,38,22,"As Brace says, when you have only two pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with great care."
FT923-8766,39,5,Brace trains extremely carefully indeed.
FT923-8766,40,9,"'Running a marathon is the easy part,' he says."
FT923-8766,41,12,'The hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performance level required'.
FT923-8766,42,18,He starts training three months before an event by running 80 miles a week and then building progressively.
FT923-8766,43,11,For the last six weeks he runs 120 miles a week.
FT923-8766,44,11,Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off.
FT923-8766,45,16,But the Olympic marathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carries no prize money.
FT923-8766,46,23,"Brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spin-offs involved, 'it does not necessarily make sense to run to win'."
FT923-8766,47,33,"Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runners will give less than their best effort."
FT923-8766,48,11,"Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely financial."
FT923-8766,49,16,"Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympic marathon, is a strong contender."
FT923-8766,50,10,"So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who came third in Seoul."
FT923-8766,51,13,Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan are also possible winners.
FT923-8766,52,18,"None of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidable ascent of Montjuic ."

LA030290-0075,35,20,"""The whole marketing approach of Bill Burke is great for sponsors,"" said Linda Paulmeno, manager of press relations for Mercedes-Benz."
LA030290-0075,36,7,"""The whole race is very marketing-oriented"" ."
LA030290-0075,37,18,"The race depends on sponsors for the bulk of its operating budget, which supports a year-round full-time staff."
LA030290-0075,38,15,"Patrick said the cost to sponsors varies from ""the mid-six-figure range to over $1 million""."
LA030290-0075,39,12,The fees depend on the services and products offered by a firm.
LA030290-0075,40,4,Trade-outs are common .
LA030290-0075,41,30,"The marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from KCOP (Channel 13) for the television rights, and the race has also been sold to cable and will be covered by radio."
LA030290-0075,42,8,The sponsors also work together for mutual benefit.
LA030290-0075,43,29,"For example, AT&T is buying commercial time on Channel 13's broadcast, and Channel 13 is providing updates on the AT&T Friendship Cup, an international race within the race ."
LA030290-0075,44,17,"In fact, television makes the race more attractive to sponsors, who figure to multiply their exposure ."
LA030290-0075,45,21,"Richard Lipeles, president of PacifiCare Health Systems, said sponsorship in the race helps separate his company in a congested health-care market."
LA030290-0075,46,8,"Also, the company provides headbands to all runners."
LA030290-0075,47,16,"""Certainly, we'd love it if every runner wore our headband during the race,"" he said ."

LA121090-0095,10,17,Their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish line did .
LA121090-0095,11,45,"By the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee Sunday morning, Benjamin Paredez Martinez of Ecatepec, Mexico, and Kathy Smith of Newport Beach were crowned winners in the San Diego Marathon at the Oceanside pier, efforts than earned them $2,000 apiece ."
LA121090-0095,12,25,"The runs set records on the new North County course, but the times, even helped by warm breezes and clear, 74-degree conditions, were hardly blistering."
LA121090-0095,13,19,"Martinez, 29, finished in 2 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds, 36 seconds faster than Doug Kurtis of Northville, Mich."
LA121090-0095,14,14,Smith's 2:43:05 seemed days quicker than the 2:52:12 posted by Escondido's Mindy Ireland .
LA121090-0095,15,18,"In years past, the marathon's mystery often has been who the leader was, not how he got there."
LA121090-0095,16,27,"Runners, often from Mexico, would register late, and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader ."
LA121090-0095,17,14,"This year, officials made sure there were no mystery men out on the course."
LA121090-0095,18,36,"They knew who Martinez was, but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro going into the 25-mile mark ."
LA121090-0095,19,9,"What Martinez did, was start out slow and deliberate."
LA121090-0095,20,13,"Through an interpreter, Martinez said he started out running 5:15 or 5:20 miles."
LA121090-0095,21,22,Rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to 10 seconds quicker per mile .
LA121090-0095,22,21,"""I knew it would kill them, that they would never keep it up,"" said Martinez, who won with a 5:18-mile pace."
LA121090-0095,23,11,"""I had to have patience and run from the back"" ."
LA121090-0095,24,26,"After the 14-mile mark, the pack has already thinned to just Rosas, Danny Bustos, Doug Kurtis and Ernesto Gutierrez, who ran single file for a time."
LA121090-0095,25,25,"Martinez and Martin Rodriguez Rivera held back, but Martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention ."
LA121090-0095,26,13,"""The first 10-15 miles, I could have been in 1,000th place,"" Martinez said."
LA121090-0095,27,3,"""I didn't care."
LA121090-0095,28,5,"Then I got worried"" ."
LA121090-0095,29,8,"Martinez left Rivera, and started on the chase."
LA121090-0095,30,29,"Since Martinez hadn't been seen earlier, it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from Mile 21 to Mile 24 was San Diego's Henry Chio ."
LA121090-0095,31,29,"Wrong. Martinez' late kick caught Rosas, who had broken away on his own for a three-mile lead at Mile 21, cramped and been surprised at the 23-mile mark ."
LA121090-0095,32,16,"""I tied up, there was nothing I could do,"" said Rosas, who was third in 2:19.49."
LA121090-0095,33,12,"""As he started closing, that's when my legs really started getting sore."
LA121090-0095,34,17,"I tried to just hang on, to hang in there, but he shot ahead of me"" ."
LA121090-0095,35,35,Before Martinez took the lead for good -- a uphill surge at Mile 25 -- it appeared Rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him .
LA121090-0095,36,4,"Not so, said Rosas."
LA121090-0095,37,15,"""The police on the bikes were telling me how close he was,"" he said ."
LA121090-0095,38,16,"It was the second marathon in two weeks that Kurtis, 38, has run, and almost won."
LA121090-0095,39,16,"The Bangkok Marathon in November was his 13th of the year, his 112th to date ."
LA121090-0095,40,41,"The only recurring theme in Martinez' and Smith's backgrounds -- other than the 26.2 miles they ran -- was that they are novices at long-distance running, this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers ."
LA121090-0095,41,19,Martinez is a world-class biathlete who finished third at the World Duathlon Championship two weeks ago near Palm Springs.
LA121090-0095,42,8,He has run only two marathons before Sunday.
LA121090-0095,43,14,"He teaches physical education in his hometown, 10-15 miles outside of Mexico City ."
LA121090-0095,44,17,"Smith, 24, was a 5,000- and 10,000-meter specialist at Stanford but is now focusing on longer distances."
LA121090-0095,45,13,She is a fourth- through sixth-grade teacher at College Park in Irvine .
LA121090-0095,46,40,"She was holding class with reporters long before Ireland, 39, was carried into a room for mandatory drug testing -- the United States Olympic Committee Drug Testing Program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top finishers ."
LA121090-0095,47,32,"""My goal was to come out here, be as low-key as possible and try to qualify for the trials,"" said Smith, who finished fourth last year and ran a personal-best time Sunday."
LA121090-0095,48,12,She met and beat the Olympic Trials qualifying standard of 2:45 .
LA121090-0095,49,27,"Smith said she and Ireland ran together -- they even chatted -- through the 20-mile mark, until Smith got her feet working faster than her mouth ."
LA121090-0095,50,20,"Having run with Ireland last year in the San Diego Marathon, Smith knew a little of Ireland's racing style ."
LA121090-0095,51,12,"""She's really tough in the latter part of a race,"" Smith said."
LA121090-0095,52,17,"""I wanted to hang back with her, so then she could carry me through the latter part."
LA121090-0095,53,8,"She hung in pretty well with me"" ."
LA121090-0095,54,24,"Smith earlier this year ran the Long Beach Marathon, where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year."
LA121090-0095,55,7,She is getting smarter about it .
LA121090-0095,56,11,"""Last year I led from Miles 13 to 22,"" Smith said."
LA121090-0095,57,8,"""This year's it's just a matter of maturity."
LA121090-0095,58,8,"And the hills were positive for me"" ."
LA121090-0095,59,18,Martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his chances were good .
LA121090-0095,60,17,"""I knew Rosas and Kurtis were good, but it was a relatively weak field,"" he said ."
LA121090-0095,61,38,"But weak field or not, the 4,000-plus runners who participated in the event seemed to relish the experience, as all the problems the marathon has had to deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line ."
LA121090-0095,62,18,"""It's a beautiful course, and this was a great marathon,"" one runner told race director Lynn Flanagan ."
LA121090-0095,63,13,"""I can't believe it went off so well,"" said another to a volunteer."

SJMN91-06105230,10,16,"And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelley starting in his 60th Boston Marathon."
SJMN91-06105230,11,12,There have only been 35 editions of this race run without him.
SJMN91-06105230,12,11,The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels.
SJMN91-06105230,13,20,They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight of the top 15 in the race's storied history.
SJMN91-06105230,14,24,"They also have resulted in a race of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely or faltering in the late stages."
SJMN91-06105230,15,32,"Along the historic route that begins in Hopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay section of the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate."
SJMN91-06105230,16,26,"For example, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 miles last year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania."
SJMN91-06105230,17,2,Neither won.
SJMN91-06105230,18,19,"The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race."
SJMN91-06105230,19,47,"Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passed them all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, the second-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob de Castella in 1986."
SJMN91-06105230,20,7,Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52.
SJMN91-06105230,21,9,It was his third consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.
SJMN91-06105230,22,10,"Ikangaa is back again, along with several other formidable Africans."
SJMN91-06105230,23,63,"They include Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya, the 1988 winner in 2:08:43, the third-fastest time in Boston and one second ahead of Ikangaa; Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the 1989 champion in 2:09:06, Boston's eighth-best time; Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya, the 1987 world champion and 1988 Olympic silver medalist who is making his Boston debut; and Naali, the third-place finisher in the 1990 Commonwealth Games."
SJMN91-06105230,24,63,"Among those chasing them will be John Treacy, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and the third-place finisher in Boston in 1988 and 1989; Geoff Smith, the Boston winner in 1984-85; Ed Eyestone, the top-ranked U.S. marathoner; Salvador Garcia, the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon; and Rolando Vera, who finished third in his marathon debut in Boston in 1990."
SJMN91-06105230,25,10,The women's division also is filled with many respectable entrants.
SJMN91-06105230,26,42,"Foremost among them are Kristiansen, the 35-year-old Norwegian who holds the world record of 2:21:06 and won in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33, the U.S.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Boston champion in 1979 and 1983."
SJMN91-06105230,27,11,"Challenging them will be Uta Pippig, Wanda Panfil and Kim Jones."
SJMN91-06105230,28,11,Pippig finished second in Boston last year in a career-best 2:28:03.
SJMN91-06105230,29,20,"Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personal best, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990 ."

WSJ870220-0106,7,23,"A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles, 385 yards."
WSJ870220-0106,8,17,And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees.
WSJ870220-0106,9,22,"Makers of cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- even a hospital -- have tagged their names to the Los Angeles Marathon."
WSJ870220-0106,10,20,"In the promoter's words, this run is ""a marketing event on legs,"" reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotions."
WSJ870220-0106,11,7,"Runners, it seems, are a well-heeled lot."
WSJ870220-0106,12,18,"A study by Mercedes-Benz found that 42% of family heads making $40,000 a year or more jog regularly."
WSJ870220-0106,13,11,"Of potential buyers showing up at Mercedes dealers, 47% are joggers."
WSJ870220-0106,14,30,"With those numbers in mind, the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- as well as other running races."
WSJ870220-0106,15,8,Marathons have had corporate backing for some time.
WSJ870220-0106,16,15,But Los Angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle.
WSJ870220-0106,17,45,"The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city."
WSJ870220-0106,18,19,"""I took air and made an event,"" says William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc."
WSJ870220-0106,19,26,"For a man whose running days ended with his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning."
WSJ870220-0106,20,33,"Last year, its first time out, the Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners -- four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- largest race in the U.S."
WSJ870220-0106,21,23,"The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leaving the organizers with $370,000 in red ink."
WSJ870220-0106,22,23,"This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even."
WSJ870220-0106,23,8,"Next year, they say, a profit is possible."
WSJ870220-0106,24,8,"More than 18,000 runners are expected this year."
WSJ870220-0106,25,33,"An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million Coca-Cola cans and 2,500 billboards around the Los Angeles area."
WSJ870220-0106,26,17,Marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors.
WSJ870220-0106,27,33,"For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and ""take over a city,"" says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter."
WSJ870220-0106,28,18,The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event.
WSJ870220-0106,29,28,"Los Angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves of bread, in addition to soda cans, billboards and other sources."
WSJ870220-0106,30,8,The venerable New York Marathon is taking note.
WSJ870220-0106,31,25,"The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted."
WSJ870220-0106,32,21,"Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the Los Angeles sponsors do."
WSJ870220-0106,33,7,The promotion in Los Angeles is unabashed.
WSJ870220-0106,34,23,"""We tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this is it,"" says Mr. Burke."
WSJ870220-0106,35,40,"The pitch has attracted the likes of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles; Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain; the Los Angeles Times; the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co. Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc."
WSJ870220-0106,36,10,"One supporter is Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer."
WSJ870220-0106,37,49,"A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in its ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes at the marathon's public ""Expo"" of sponsors' wares, and posting a dozen big street banners along the course."
WSJ870220-0106,38,21,"The company has rented more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor."
WSJ870220-0106,39,6,"The discount, about 50%, was important."
WSJ870220-0106,40,15,"""We couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally,"" says Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director."
WSJ870220-0106,41,15,"Ellesse, which also sponsors the New York run, finds the West Coast event more freewheeling."
WSJ870220-0106,42,11,"""They have let us do whatever we want,"" says Ms. Cialone."
WSJ870220-0106,43,22,"For instance, product banners along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in New York -- are a snap in Los Angeles."
WSJ870220-0106,44,10,"The city, in fact, is a partner in the race."
WSJ870220-0106,45,18,"After competitive bidding, it awarded an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race."
WSJ870220-0106,46,25,"The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city."
WSJ870220-0106,47,16,"The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon, estimated at $100,000."
WSJ870220-0106,48,24,The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics.
WSJ870220-0106,49,11,The logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath.
WSJ870220-0106,50,14,Some posters show the Los Angeles Coliseum with its torch and giant Olympic symbol.
WSJ870220-0106,51,10,"""The World Returns to Los Angeles,"" proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad."
WSJ870220-0106,52,21,"Race directors are called ""commissioners,"" a term borrowed from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke was commissioner of tennis."
WSJ870220-0106,53,18,"And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying the race as a civic celebration, thrives on volunteers."
WSJ870220-0106,54,14,"Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day."
WSJ870220-0106,55,10,And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay.
WSJ870220-0106,56,13,"""I couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesturing around the crowded race headquarters."
WSJ870220-0106,57,5,Not everyone works for free.
WSJ870220-0106,58,10,"Big-name runners, for instance, want to be paid a lot."
WSJ870220-0106,59,7,"And here, the organizers have pinched pennies."
WSJ870220-0106,60,27,"While some runners will be paid to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lacks some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London."
WSJ870220-0106,61,19,"Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles; she was turned down."
WSJ870220-0106,62,38,"Mr. Burke says the Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but, for $25,000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event was tempting."
WSJ870220-0106,63,8,Mr. Burke says he slammed down the phone.
WSJ870220-0106,64,20,"""We won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners,"" he says."
WSJ870220-0106,65,8,Mr. de Castella's agent denies the story entirely.
WSJ870220-0106,66,14,"What Los Angeles lacks in superstars, it plans to make up for in numbers."
WSJ870220-0106,67,15,This year's race may challenge New York and London as the largest marathon ever run.
WSJ870220-0106,68,9,"Some 20,500 started the New York race last year."
WSJ870220-0106,69,18,"Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number."
WSJ870220-0106,70,9,"For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing."
WSJ870220-0106,71,21,"Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign, provides emergency care stations along the marathon route."
WSJ870220-0106,72,9,"Last year, one of every 20 runners needed aid."
WSJ870220-0106,73,14,"Along with sprains, strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia."
WSJ870220-0106,74,12,"A spokeswoman says: ""We advised 250 people to quit the race"" ."
WSJ910326-0090,10,14,Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his 60th Boston Marathon.
WSJ910326-0090,11,31,"And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April 15."
WSJ910326-0090,12,17,"Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr."
WSJ910326-0090,13,13,"Kelley: ""It's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing."
WSJ910326-0090,14,7,I'm struggling at the age of 43.
WSJ910326-0090,15,6,". . . This isn't golf""."
WSJ910326-0090,16,17,Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of Mr.
WSJ910326-0090,17,5,Kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping.
WSJ910326-0090,18,22,"""Aghast is more like it,"" says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago."
WSJ910326-0090,19,6,"""My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever'."
WSJ910326-0090,20,10,"I can't even remember when I ran my last marathon""."
WSJ910326-0090,21,18,John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare.
WSJ910326-0090,22,33,"A two-time winner in Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr. Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years."
WSJ910326-0090,23,19,"Mr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass., where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen."
WSJ910326-0090,24,11,"(""That means I don't have to pay taxes there,"" he jokes)."
WSJ910326-0090,25,29,"Two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr. Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by ""groupies,"" as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand."
WSJ910326-0090,26,22,"Last year, five Japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards, as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race."
WSJ910326-0090,27,17,"Recalls Suni Tomomitsu, one of the runners: ""At first we thought, `Oh, wow, he's like Mafia man'."
WSJ910326-0090,28,10,"Then we said, `Oh no, this is nice Johnny Kelley'."
WSJ910326-0090,29,5,"In Japan, he is awesome""."
WSJ910326-0090,30,20,"Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it."
WSJ910326-0090,31,17,"Peter Foley, who was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well into his 80s."
WSJ910326-0090,32,5,But he walked the course.
WSJ910326-0090,33,22,"Starting at dawn (six hours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight."
WSJ910326-0090,34,41,"Of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds."
WSJ910326-0090,35,13,"His best time ever was in 1945: 2 hours, 30 minutes, 40 seconds."
WSJ910326-0090,36,9,"Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5 minutes."
WSJ910326-0090,37,7,He hopes to do better in 1991.
WSJ910326-0090,38,9,"""That's not a prediction, just a goal,"" he says."
WSJ910326-0090,39,32,"When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bush wasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio was an unknown and Nike was the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe."
WSJ910326-0090,40,24,"In those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he ran in black leather high-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade."
WSJ910326-0090,41,18,"""I would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today,"" he says."
WSJ910326-0090,42,10,"Back then, the sport didn't have much of a following."
WSJ910326-0090,43,24,"Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, covered by TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogether in prize money."
WSJ910326-0090,44,10,"""The winners get a medal and $55,000,"" says Mr. Kelley."
WSJ910326-0090,45,7,"""I got a medal and beef stew."
WSJ910326-0090,46,5,"God bless them,"" he adds."
WSJ910326-0090,47,3,"""They deserve it""."
WSJ910326-0090,48,9,"The rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder."
WSJ910326-0090,49,19,"Each year, he visits the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Center in Dallas for a battery of endurance tests."
WSJ910326-0090,50,17,"""Physiologically, whatever that means, I got all A's,"" Mr. Kelley reports of his checkup four months ago."
WSJ910326-0090,51,37,"""What that means,"" explains Kenneth Cooper, the physician who wrote ""Aerobics"" and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes, ""is that Johnny has the body of a man 23 years younger."
WSJ910326-0090,52,11,"He's going to be one of the stars of my book""."
WSJ910326-0090,53,19,Mr. Kelley's resting pulse rate -- 60 beats a minute -- is well below the average person's 72 beats.
WSJ910326-0090,54,2,(That's good).
WSJ910326-0090,55,17,"On the stress test the clinic gives, Mr. Kelley holds the endurance record for his age group."
WSJ910326-0090,56,25,"A mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retired in 1972, Mr. Kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago."
WSJ910326-0090,57,10,His only purpose was to relax and have some fun.
WSJ910326-0090,58,14,"""All day long, I did what my boss told me to do,"" he recalls."
WSJ910326-0090,59,9,"""But when I ran at night, I felt free."
WSJ910326-0090,60,6,"I ran till I was exhausted""."
WSJ910326-0090,61,15,"In 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first Boston Marathon but didn't finish."
WSJ910326-0090,62,10,He dropped out three-quarters of the way through the race.
WSJ910326-0090,63,13,"Then, in 1933, he finished 37th in a field of about 200 runners."
WSJ910326-0090,64,14,"In all the years since, he has missed the race just once, in 1967."
WSJ910326-0090,65,14,"(He has competed, all told, in 112 marathons, including the 1936 and 1948 Olympics."
WSJ910326-0090,66,39,"Mr. Kelley well knows the jagged course from Hopkinton to downtown Boston: The first challenge comes five miles into the race, where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes."
WSJ910326-0090,67,21,"A mile and a half later, there's new reason to beware: The smells of Cavanaugh's Bakery can set off hunger pangs."
WSJ910326-0090,68,9,An Exxon station in Wellesley marks the halfway point.
WSJ910326-0090,69,13,A steep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tired runner's bones.
WSJ910326-0090,70,18,"Then, at the end of a long column of oak and maple trees, is Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis."
WSJ910326-0090,71,9,"It cost him at least two victories, he says."
WSJ910326-0090,72,13,"And finally there's the Haunted Mile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed."
WSJ910326-0090,73,13,"Boston's skyline, 2 1/2 miles in the distance, can seem so far away."
WSJ910326-0090,74,13,"Though still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year."
WSJ910326-0090,75,5,"To compensate, he trains harder."
WSJ910326-0090,76,12,He used to start preparing in earnest at the end of January.
WSJ910326-0090,77,38,"""In recent years, I've been in training 12 months a year,"" he says, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hour run, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs every other week -- begins in December."
WSJ910326-0090,78,29,"(He doesn't count the miles he puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, but he says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles a week)."
WSJ910326-0090,79,21,"Mr. Kelley always trains at 5 a.m., and alone: ""It's a quiet time, no traffic; the air is fresh and sweet""."
WSJ910326-0090,80,3,His routes vary.
WSJ910326-0090,81,10,"In January, he prefers the frozen sands of the beach."
WSJ910326-0090,82,26,"With the approach of spring, he takes to the alder and scrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over Cape Cod Bay."
WSJ910326-0090,83,26,"After his morning run, he spends a couple of hours painting (still lifes and Cape Cod scenes), a hobby he took up about 25 years ago."
WSJ910326-0090,84,16,"Unlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning."
WSJ910326-0090,85,26,"""This is my warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot, but I don't plug it in. I set up the breakfast table."
WSJ910326-0090,86,12,"Then I check the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear""."
WSJ910326-0090,87,27,"He and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-style house here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies, medals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scattered about."
WSJ910326-0090,88,26,"He isn't particular about brands of shoes (""I wear them all"") or what he eats (""I never eat broccoli, but I love steak and ice cream"")."
WSJ910326-0090,89,13,Mr. Kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.
WSJ910326-0090,90,13,"""He's a strange man,"" says Laura Kelley, in awe of her husband's vigor."
WSJ910326-0090,91,22,"The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley adds, ""I just try to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doing that""."
WSJ910326-0090,92,19,"In a rare moment of reflection, Mr. Kelley explains what makes him tick: ""I paint because I like it."
WSJ910326-0090,93,6,I run because I like it.
WSJ910326-0090,94,16,"If for some reason I don't finish the marathon, I don't owe an apology to anyone."
WSJ910326-0090,95,19,"But I'll tell you, the Boston Marathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than my birthday."""
AP880512-0096,7,31,"A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media."
AP880512-0096,8,33,"But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that topic is still too sensitive."
AP880512-0096,9,40,"In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me''."
AP880512-0096,10,35,Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca for Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to return from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.

AP880512-0096,15,35,"While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said."

AP880512-0157,17,36,"Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan."

AP880729-0155,9,25,"Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying ``nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms."
AP880729-0155,10,35,"The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to ``active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups''."
AP880729-0155,11,12,"``Perestroika,'' or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change."
AP880729-0155,12,31,State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
AP880729-0155,13,24,"The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February."
AP880729-0155,14,12,"The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18."
AP880729-0155,15,18,It rejected any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the region's economy and culture.
AP880729-0155,16,24,The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985.
AP880729-0155,17,24,"He indicated Friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis."
AP880729-0155,18,14,"Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body."
AP880729-0155,19,13,A summary of his remarks was distributed by the official Tass news agency.
AP880729-0155,20,22,"Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a ``current aggravation'' of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said."
AP880729-0155,21,42,"Among the causes, Gorbachev listed ``a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups''."
AP880729-0155,22,24,"Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that ``nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces,'' he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife."
AP880729-0155,23,8,Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion.
AP880729-0155,24,23,"At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive."
AP880729-0155,25,33,"Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law can punish ``any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt''."
AP880729-0155,26,50,"Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions."
AP880729-0155,27,29,"In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs."

AP891213-0164,16,43,"The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas."
AP891213-0164,17,40,"The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated."

AP891213-0164,19,34,"The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions."
AP891213-0164,20,27,"It was also a potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims."

AP891213-0164,28,29,The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts.

AP901230-0022,18,31,"In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass Moldavian language tests by 1995."
AP901230-0022,19,12,Tass did not say how the Moldavian parliament would modify the law.

FBIS4-62505,15,45,"[Text] Dushanbe 16 May TASS -- The Tajik Communist Party has called for the restoration of a renovated Soviet Union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political, economic, and spiritual potential of former Soviet republics."
FBIS4-62505,16,35,Tajik communists' leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics.
FBIS4-62505,17,31,"Radical market reforms ""imposed by quasi- democrats"" and ""wild privatisation"" have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger, he said."
FBIS4-62505,18,19,The mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-Soviet republics and outburst of nationalism.
FBIS4-62505,19,5,Tajikistan was hit most hard.
FBIS4-62505,20,16,"The civil war in the Republic claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, Shabdolov said."
FBIS4-62505,21,19,He noted that the majority of the population support Tajik communists' call for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
FBIS4-62505,22,34,"Over one million people, about two-thirds of the adult population, signed appeals ""for unity, brotherhood and friendship of the peoples of the USSR"" adopted by numerous conferences and meetings held all across the Republic."

FT921-4937,15,27,"Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians."
FT921-4937,16,19,"Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent."
FT921-4937,17,14,The little republic (4.5m people) was slow to respond to the stirrings of reform.
FT921-4937,18,42,"When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee."
FT921-4937,19,60,"From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov."
FT921-4937,20,32,"During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule."
FT921-4937,21,8,"Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces."
FT921-4937,22,22,The Trans Dnestr side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders.
FT921-4937,23,32,"The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities) ."

FT921-5959,8,28,"Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce."
FT921-5959,9,11,The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians.
FT921-5959,10,31,The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
FT921-5959,11,13,"Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the regiment is based."
FT921-5959,12,13,Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack.
FT921-5959,13,29,"Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union."
FT921-5959,14,8,No dates have been given for the withdrawal.
FT921-5959,15,11,Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.

FT923-13244,8,33,Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
FT923-13244,9,25,Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali.
FT923-13244,10,23,"But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation."
FT923-13244,11,32,"The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders."
FT923-13244,12,24,Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists.
FT923-13244,13,30,"In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people."
FT923-13244,14,32,Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.
FT923-13244,15,21,"South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin."
FT923-13244,16,12,Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
FT923-13244,17,16,The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and matching chevrons on their sleeves.
FT923-13244,18,26,"They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under the nominal command of North Ossetian leaders."
FT923-13244,19,19,"The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides, opening the way to future talks."
FT923-13244,20,32,"The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities."

FT924-10185,7,33,"RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire."
FT924-10185,8,26,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 miles south of Moscow."
FT924-10185,9,25,"The troops were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes."
FT924-10185,10,18,Scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several days.
FT924-10185,11,18,Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian interior ministry soldiers based in the region.
FT924-10185,12,36,"A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said."
FT924-10185,13,29,"The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia."
FT924-10185,14,18,Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday.

FT924-10185,16,30,"'The Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television."

FT934-2439,6,35,"The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union."
FT934-2439,7,7,The problem is indeed a pressing one.
FT934-2439,8,21,"The disputes in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved."
FT934-2439,9,19,"They are a source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who are worried by clashes close to their borders."
FT934-2439,10,39,"They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts, and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia (whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m)."
FT934-2439,11,17,They believe that the problems in some of the former Soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood.
FT934-2439,12,15,"The Russians fear that if they do nothing, the conflicts will worsen and probably spread."
FT934-2439,13,17,They argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security.
FT934-2439,14,32,"They ask why, when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them."
FT934-2439,15,29,"Equally, these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain, its western partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability."
FT934-2439,16,23,"If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to European security, including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism."
FT934-2439,17,27,"Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations with the west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us."
FT934-2439,18,8,The west is sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude.
FT934-2439,19,21,There are no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there are differences over how to go about it.
FT934-2439,20,21,The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces.
FT934-2439,21,30,Nor are countries that secured their independence when the Soviet Union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire.
FT934-2439,22,8,They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty.
FT934-2439,23,22,"When they are willing for Russian troops to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form of international monitoring."
FT934-2439,24,35,"This has meant that, even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it has been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial tendencies."
FT934-2439,25,30,"If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all these concerns."
FT934-2439,26,11,Clearly Russia has an important role to play in this area.
FT934-2439,27,39,"If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community, the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former Soviet Union."
FT934-2439,28,16,"Peace-keeping in the former Soviet Union, as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognised principles."
FT934-2439,29,12,It needs to be looked at on a case by case basis.
FT934-2439,30,12,Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount.
FT934-2439,31,75,"We agreed that the principles underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational in character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed."
FT934-2439,32,32,"These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former Soviet Union."
FT934-2439,33,8,All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices.
FT934-2439,34,41,"Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves, they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process."
FT934-2439,35,22,"Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might help improve training for Russian peacekeepers."
FT934-2439,36,10,This is an area we shall need to explore further.
FT934-2439,37,11,We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy.
FT934-2439,38,27,One of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union.
FT934-2439,39,30,"The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role here, drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles."
FT934-2439,40,24,"We discussed ways of strengthening the CSCE's role, including the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting."
FT934-2439,41,16,We must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they erupt into conflict.
FT934-2439,42,9,"It will not be easy, but we must try."
FT934-2439,43,22,Potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions.
FT934-2439,44,12,We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership.
FT934-2439,45,8,And we need to deal with it urgently.
FT934-2439,46,26,Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all.

LA070289-0167,9,35,Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms .
LA070289-0167,10,44,"Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country, Gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the Soviet Union apart ."
LA070289-0167,11,32,"As president, Gorbachev said, it is his ""duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society, for every family and for every person"" ."
LA070289-0167,12,25,"""The fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake,"" he declared in a sober, 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television."
LA070289-0167,13,28,"""Irresponsible slogans, political instigation, setting one national group against another, the domination of some ethnic groups by others -- this could lead to disaster for us all ."
LA070289-0167,14,33,"""The living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness"" ."
LA070289-0167,15,69,"With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances ."
LA070289-0167,16,30,"Even as he spoke, Soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an area with many Azerbaijanis."
LA070289-0167,17,34,"Roving gangs, armed with hunting rifles, gasoline bombs and other weapons, had clashed in three towns south of the capital of Tbilisi last week, leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded ."
LA070289-0167,18,45,"Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors ."
LA070289-0167,19,40,"Those who encourage the unrest are ""playing with fire,"" Gorbachev said, warning that the government will use its full powers and take ""the most decisive measures"" against those provoking the clashes, organizing attacks on minority groups or urging secession ."
LA070289-0167,20,58,"Nearly 300 people have been killed in communal clashes and related political disturbances over the past two years; tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes, including 40,000 last month alone, to seek refuge from the violence, and nearly 25,000 special troops are now deployed in various parts of the country to maintain order ."
LA070289-0167,21,35,"""There will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken the criminal path,"" Gorbachev said, warning of stern measures against those engaged in communal violence or in political agitation ."
LA070289-0167,22,3,Political Energy Drained
LA070289-0167,23,60,"The ethnic strife, much of it rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the Stalinist era, has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change ."
LA070289-0167,24,45,"For Gorbachev, the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the Soviet Union, a superpower in world terms, cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government -- nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms ."
LA070289-0167,25,30,"If the strife here continued and grew, he asked, ""What kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world""?"
LA070289-0167,26,41,"Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic republics and in Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, a Soviet republic on the Romanian border ."
LA070289-0167,27,33,"The whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level Communist Party conference here late last week, and Gorbachev's unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts ."
LA070289-0167,28,38,"Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are ""wound in a tight knot of contradictions"" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new ""Soviet nationality"" with a unified culture ."
LA070289-0167,29,22,"This policy had, in fact, collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse ."
LA070289-0167,30,27,"Past economic policies, including the ""stagnation"" in many regions under the regime of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, had also made the problems more acute ."
LA070289-0167,31,49,"""We are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades -- the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups,"" Gorbachev said, alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator Josef Stalin ."
LA070289-0167,32,52,"""Such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests, to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions, deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the country's different peoples, the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in inter-ethnic relations"" ."
LA070289-0167,33,61,"Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated again by the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new national assembly, Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates, and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis ."
LA070289-0167,34,3,Right of Equality
LA070289-0167,35,34,"""Everyone, regardless of his nationality, should feel an equal citizen in any part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights guaranteed by the Soviet Union's constitution,"" he said ."
LA070289-0167,36,44,"The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country, Gorbachev said, alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month in which about 100 people died ."
LA070289-0167,37,53,"The Soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling of various ethnic groups that they are ""at home in their own land"" and could preserve and develop their own cultures, languages and social traditions, with the Soviet Union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system ."
LA070289-0167,38,19,But he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there is a balance of rights.
LA070289-0167,39,15,"""We have lived and will continue to live in a multi-ethnic community,"" he observed ."
LA070289-0167,40,30,"Gorbachev said that ""profound transformations in the Soviet federation"" are clearly essential, promising further political reforms to make it a real federation and not just one in name only ."
LA070289-0167,41,2,Demands Rejected
LA070289-0167,42,38,"But he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence demanded by some nationalists, particularly in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories."
LA070289-0167,43,12,"The Soviet Union's ethnic groups have ""a common destiny,"" Gorbachev said ."
LA070289-0167,44,39,"""In quest of the better, one should not embark on the path of destroying what has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and what can be multiplied within its framework,"" he said ."

AP890323-0234,12,30,The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon.
AP890323-0234,13,49,"Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the De Soto store."
AP890323-0234,14,17,Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.
AP890323-0234,15,22,His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field.
AP890323-0234,16,23,"Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out''."
AP890323-0234,17,11,"By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company."
AP890323-0234,18,28,"Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called."
AP890323-0234,19,15,"To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is the customer is always right."
AP890323-0234,20,13,"Rule No.2 says just in case the customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1''."
AP890323-0234,21,20,"If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say."
AP890323-0234,22,23,He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
AP890323-0234,23,10,"He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though."
AP890323-0234,24,12,He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that hospitality to customers is crucial.
AP890323-0234,25,13,He preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
AP890323-0234,26,27,"Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s."
AP890323-0234,27,13,One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he's amassed.
AP890323-0234,28,22,A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything'' not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people.
AP890323-0234,29,17,The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.

AP890323-0234,35,24,"After serving three years in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee."
AP890323-0234,36,25,"The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962."
AP890323-0234,37,14,The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S. retail trade.
AP890323-0234,38,11,Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.
AP890323-0234,39,20,Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are involved with the company in various capacities.
AP890323-0234,40,28,"Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia, now in remission."
AP890323-0234,41,15,He spends less time in the office since handing over most responsiblities to David Glass.
AP890323-0234,42,7,Sam is still chairman of the board.
AP890323-0234,43,11,Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourish without Sam.
AP890323-0234,44,13,"The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, ``We have great people''."
AP890323-0234,45,9,"The Walton family will always be involved, he adds."
AP890323-0234,46,14,"Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what we produce today."
AP890323-0234,47,9,"Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't matter.''"

AP890615-0263,13,21,"Walton often attends promotional events for his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance."
AP890615-0263,14,8,Walton continued talking with customers during the concert.
AP890615-0263,15,18,He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.
AP890615-0263,16,23,"``He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and the customers went right along with him,'' Sively said."
AP890615-0263,17,9,``He even got down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''
AP890711-0223,9,31,"He's ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor."
AP890711-0223,10,18,"``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce."
AP890711-0223,11,4,``He's a neat person.
AP890711-0223,12,10,"He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us''."
AP890711-0223,13,30,"Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires."
AP890711-0223,14,23,"According to Forbes magazine's July 24 edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion."
AP890711-0223,15,28,"``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock."
AP890711-0223,16,18,"Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers."
AP890711-0223,17,16,Shinkle said news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for comments from him.
AP890711-0223,18,7,But the 71-year-old businessman declined to comment.
AP890711-0223,19,25,"``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,'' Shinkle said."
AP890711-0223,20,8,``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings.
AP890711-0223,21,12,It just puts him in a position he doesn't want to be''.
AP890711-0223,22,9,But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty.
AP890711-0223,23,37,"Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper."
AP890711-0223,24,5,Walton then changed the subject.
AP890711-0223,25,14,Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.
AP890711-0223,26,11,"Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people."
AP890711-0223,27,11,Walton made that listing as the richest American every year since.
AP890711-0223,28,9,"This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese businessmen."
AP890711-0223,29,30,"Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago."
AP890711-0223,30,15,"He is out of the office up to four days a week, the spokesman said."
AP890711-0223,31,23,"``He spends most of his time talking to associates and customers,'' Shinkle said, ``and he always comes back with many ideas from them''."
AP890711-0223,32,9,Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
AP890711-0223,33,29,"When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans, recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks."
AP890711-0223,34,17,"``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc."
AP890711-0223,35,14,"``You'd think that he'd be living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas."
AP890711-0223,36,6,But now people just accept it.
AP890711-0223,37,14,"``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,''' Simpson said ."
AP900507-0207,7,26,"Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle, Walton's 5&10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire."
AP900507-0207,8,25,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950."
AP900507-0207,9,16,"The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations."
AP900507-0207,10,17,It concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
AP900507-0207,11,23,"The window displays date back to the store's opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow."
AP900507-0207,12,11,"Inside, an electronic map details the company's 1,500-plus store chain today."
AP900507-0207,13,37,"Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his ``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984."
AP900507-0207,14,7,The goal was accomplished and he danced.
AP900507-0207,15,22,The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of Detroit.
AP900507-0207,16,13,"Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962."
AP900507-0207,17,22,"Both will be on hand for the opening, along with a sprinkling of other dignitaries, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the dedication speaker."
AP900507-0207,18,29,"Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago."
AP900507-0207,19,19,"Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s."
AP900507-0207,20,24,"Typical of the Wal-Mart outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed ``a place to grow and to dream'' in a video on the Walton family."
AP900507-0207,21,20,"After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben Franklin store in Newport in 1945."
AP900507-0207,22,11,"He lost the lease on that one, and relocated to Bentonville."
AP900507-0207,23,6,That's where the story took off.
AP900507-0207,24,22,"Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955."
AP900507-0207,25,37,"Walton ``said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores'' and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview."
AP900507-0207,26,13,That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's ``learn as you go'' training program.
AP900507-0207,27,18,"``I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing the floor with Sam,'' Bogle said."
AP900507-0207,28,8,Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story.
AP900507-0207,29,33,"In one video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964."
AP900507-0207,30,9,"The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier."
AP900507-0207,31,30,"``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was president of a drugstore chain at the time."
AP900507-0207,32,36,"And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really didn't see a future in it''."
AP900507-0207,33,52,"Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right time''."
AP900507-0207,34,17,"At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed 272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion."
AP900507-0207,35,20,Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market .
FT922-14265,6,11,SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
FT922-14265,7,33,"The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson."
FT922-14265,8,28,"By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest."
FT922-14265,9,15,"Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs."
FT922-14265,10,16,The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.
FT922-14265,11,41,"He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted on calling 'associates'."
FT922-14265,12,21,"He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management buzz-words."
FT922-14265,13,26,Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy.
FT922-14265,14,27,"He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for good performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy."
FT922-14265,15,28,"Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall Street."
FT922-14265,16,29,"Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty."
FT922-14265,17,6,'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.
FT922-14265,18,24,"Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south."
FT922-14265,19,44,"It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business, though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations ."

FT923-5068,6,27,"MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORY By Sam Walton Doubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pages Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out."
FT923-5068,7,19,The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright.
FT923-5068,8,17,"In a country where business practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve."
FT923-5068,9,11,"A vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws."
FT923-5068,10,23,"Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most."
FT923-5068,11,29,"When, in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by chicken farmers, where Walton made his home."
FT923-5068,12,28,"What they found was a happily married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two hub-caps."
FT923-5068,13,4,Folksy was an understatement.
FT923-5068,14,30,"Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies, the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops -have been subject to critical scrutiny."
FT923-5068,15,14,"So, to an extent, have the less wholesome adventures of the four Walton children."
FT923-5068,16,13,But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad.
FT923-5068,17,12,The worst that has been said is that he was rather dull.
FT923-5068,18,8,Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions.
FT923-5068,19,19,"Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if charming, anecdotes."
FT923-5068,20,8,Or they will find it dreary and downbeat.
FT923-5068,21,36,"Walton makes no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate . . . '."
FT923-5068,22,9,A few snippets are more revealing about the character.
FT923-5068,23,27,There cannot be many billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
FT923-5068,24,13,"Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business is inescapable."
FT923-5068,25,36,"In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing his rival's stock."
FT923-5068,26,30,"And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission."
FT923-5068,27,17,"But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best."
FT923-5068,28,29,"Explaining the annual contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets for carrying bait."
FT923-5068,29,8,Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice.
FT923-5068,30,36,"'So I would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . . put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket."
FT923-5068,31,13,I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit.
FT923-5068,32,17,"It drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . '."
FT923-5068,33,15,But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth.
FT923-5068,34,31,"Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies."
FT923-5068,35,12,"For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait."
FT923-5068,36,4,"Occasionally, it just grates."
FT923-5068,37,28,"'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits."
FT923-5068,38,10,But it helped me learn a lot about financing things'.
FT923-5068,39,9,"Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?"
FT923-5068,40,31,"The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written this book'."
FT923-5068,41,35,"Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it."
FT923-5068,42,14,But these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis.
FT923-5068,43,18,"At the end of the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores ."

FT944-12170,6,47,"'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton."
FT944-12170,7,22,"Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen."
FT944-12170,8,36,"The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer."
FT944-12170,9,35,"His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn."
FT944-12170,10,12,What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth.
FT944-12170,11,28,"Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store."
FT944-12170,12,38,"At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers."
FT944-12170,13,19,"Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US."
FT944-12170,14,23,"Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest."
FT944-12170,15,9,"Within another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both."
FT944-12170,16,18,"Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death, however, published material about the company is curiously scarce."
FT944-12170,17,32,"This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved."
FT944-12170,18,15,One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers.
FT944-12170,19,7,Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing.
FT944-12170,20,39,"Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart."
FT944-12170,21,40,"Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed."
FT944-12170,22,7,Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology.
FT944-12170,23,36,"As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life."
FT944-12170,24,44,"Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system."
FT944-12170,25,15,This technology helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.
FT944-12170,26,21,"But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure."
FT944-12170,27,43,"Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every Friday."
FT944-12170,28,25,"They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results."
FT944-12170,29,29,"District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads."
FT944-12170,30,28,"The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation begin the following week."
FT944-12170,31,9,"Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however."
FT944-12170,32,40,"One was Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins."
FT944-12170,33,14,"Another was Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for gigantist America."
FT944-12170,34,26,Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984.
FT944-12170,35,5,"It did, and he did."
FT944-12170,36,22,The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the economies of small US towns was positive or negative.
FT944-12170,37,23,"If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer."
FT944-12170,38,27,"Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the US."
FT944-12170,39,19,But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in building his own American dream .

AP900422-0032,9,26,"Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope."
AP900422-0032,10,11,Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
AP900422-0032,11,22,"``We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time,'' said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver."
AP900422-0032,12,19,"``We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do."
AP900422-0032,13,11,"That's kind of the name of the game here,'' Shriver said."
AP900422-0032,14,22,NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition.
AP900422-0032,15,7,The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon.
AP900422-0032,16,18,A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10.
AP900422-0032,17,14,"The unit was replaced with a new one, which tests showed to be fine."
AP900422-0032,18,12,"``Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time,'' Leinbach said."
AP900422-0032,19,28,"A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer."
AP900422-0032,20,17,A weak cold front from the north was expected to pass through the area by Monday night.
AP900422-0032,21,11,"The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said."
AP900422-0032,22,27,"As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery."
AP900422-0032,23,18,It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously.
AP900422-0032,24,15,"The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded."
AP900422-0032,25,22,Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast with his shuttle.
AP900422-0032,26,26,"NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay."
AP900422-0032,27,16,"``In some cases, it could be a problem'' having shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said."
AP900422-0032,28,7,"``In this particular case, everything's fitting together''."
AP900422-0032,29,10,NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground.
AP900422-0032,30,17,"After that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's batteries can be recharged."
AP900422-0032,31,27,The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
AP900422-0032,32,21,"Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror."
AP900422-0032,33,31,"Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere."
AP900422-0032,34,26,"During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mysteries."
AP900422-0032,35,16,Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope.
AP900422-0032,36,25,"The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through the solar system."
AP900422-0032,37,18,"Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but were delayed by the Challenger accident ."
AP900424-0048,11,32,Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
AP900424-0048,12,25,"``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities."
AP900424-0048,13,27,Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
AP900424-0048,14,22,More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
AP900424-0048,15,22,"The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center."
AP900424-0048,16,30,"The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program."
AP900424-0048,17,7,``It's going to change our perspective altogether.
AP900424-0048,18,19,"I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things''."
AP900424-0048,19,31,"Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere."
AP900424-0048,20,6,It is the 35th shuttle mission.
AP900424-0048,21,39,"Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion."
AP900424-0048,22,20,"Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident."
AP900424-0048,23,24,"The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle."
AP900424-0048,24,25,"The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families."
AP900424-0048,25,22,"The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space."
AP900424-0048,26,14,Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
AP900424-0048,27,26,"Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900424-0048,28,18,Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff.
AP900424-0048,29,23,"However, NASA said it will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ a week after launch."
AP900424-0048,30,26,"In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument."
AP900424-0048,31,14,The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
AP900424-0048,32,17,NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space.
AP900424-0048,33,23,"During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories."
AP900424-0048,34,25,"As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years."
AP900424-0048,35,27,"Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars."
AP900424-0048,36,15,Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
AP900424-0048,37,21,"The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding."
AP900424-0048,38,18,His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
AP900424-0048,39,20,"In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive."
AP900424-0048,40,8,It is the skull's third trip into space.
AP900424-0048,41,18,"The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif ."
AP900424-0096,10,33,"Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time."
AP900424-0096,11,25,"Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal."
AP900424-0096,12,14,"At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston."
AP900424-0096,13,16,"``As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect,'' said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle."
AP900424-0096,14,17,Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
AP900424-0096,15,32,"Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle."
AP900424-0096,16,23,There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
AP900424-0096,17,5,``Our window on the universe''!
AP900424-0096,18,15,NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
AP900424-0096,19,28,"``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly."
AP900424-0096,20,7,``Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted''.
AP900424-0096,21,19,"The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment."
AP900424-0096,22,26,It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
AP900424-0096,23,18,"While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness."
AP900424-0096,24,22,"In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland."
AP900424-0096,25,36,On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
AP900424-0096,26,22,Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station.
AP900424-0096,27,26,"``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars'''? said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut."
AP900424-0096,28,15,"``It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right''."
AP900424-0096,29,19,"The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car."
AP900424-0096,30,25,"When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side."
AP900424-0096,31,30,"It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling."
AP900424-0096,32,24,That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion _ the Big Bang _ created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
AP900424-0096,33,18,The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
AP900424-0096,34,4,How big is it?
AP900424-0096,35,14,"The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches."
AP900424-0096,36,14,"Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer."
AP900424-0096,37,17,"In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances."
AP900424-0096,38,38,"On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own."
AP900424-0096,39,12,"In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle."
AP900424-0096,40,30,But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun.
AP900424-0096,41,35,"Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually."
AP900424-0096,42,7,Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
AP900424-0096,43,27,"With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process."
AP900424-0096,44,17,"The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late."
AP900424-0096,45,18,The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
AP900424-0096,46,21,"``On the way uphill,'' as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with ``several flecks of things''."
AP900424-0096,47,27,He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit.
AP900424-0096,48,20,"The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative."
AP900424-0096,49,6,Neither problem was considered serious .
AP900425-0198,11,35,"After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds."
AP900425-0198,12,27,Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
AP900425-0198,13,22,"``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said."
AP900425-0198,14,26,"``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later."
AP900425-0198,15,28,"The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned."
AP900425-0198,16,5,The shuttle then backed away.
AP900425-0198,17,22,"``Thank you very much for the ride,'' said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md."
AP900425-0198,18,22,"Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel."
AP900425-0198,19,5,That proved to be unnecessary.
AP900425-0198,20,18,"``Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did,'' Sullivan said."
AP900425-0198,21,15,She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
AP900425-0198,22,27,"The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast."
AP900425-0198,23,16,"It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge."
AP900425-0198,24,9,"Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome."
AP900425-0198,25,20,"It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again."
AP900425-0198,26,10,A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
AP900425-0198,27,9,"``Houston, we see motion,'' Commander Loren J. Shriver reported."
AP900425-0198,28,32,Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
AP900425-0198,29,25,Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries.
AP900425-0198,30,20,"``At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power,'' Carr said."
AP900425-0198,31,4,``The game has begun.
AP900425-0198,32,4,The race is on.
AP900425-0198,33,4,The clock is ticking''.
AP900425-0198,34,19,Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
AP900425-0198,35,28,"Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope."
AP900425-0198,36,16,"Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown."
AP900425-0198,37,16,The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
AP900425-0198,38,8,Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
AP900425-0198,39,31,"``I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today,'' Shriver said of Hawley."
AP900425-0198,40,13,Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space.
AP900425-0198,41,19,"The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back."
AP900425-0198,42,34,The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.
AP900425-0198,43,18,"On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others."
AP900425-0198,44,18,"The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900425-0198,45,12,Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly.
AP900425-0198,46,16,"If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space."
AP900425-0198,47,23,"Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened."
AP900425-0198,48,25,"``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he said."
AP900425-0198,49,15,The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments.
AP900425-0198,50,15,"If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif."
AP900425-0198,51,23,NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday.
AP900425-0198,52,8,Data will follow in a month or two.
AP900425-0198,53,29,"Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years."
AP900425-0198,54,19,"They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago."
AP900425-0198,55,22,"The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding."
AP900425-0198,56,15,He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation .
AP900426-0135,13,34,Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
AP900426-0135,14,23,"Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved."
AP900426-0135,15,24,"``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis."
AP900426-0135,16,36,"Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard."
AP900426-0135,17,27,"In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees."
AP900426-0135,18,23,"The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well."
AP900426-0135,19,12,"Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems."
AP900426-0135,20,14,The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned.
AP900426-0135,21,19,"The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments."
AP900426-0135,22,27,"Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem."
AP900426-0135,23,17,"It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said."
AP900426-0135,24,23,The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.
AP900426-0135,25,13,"``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman."
AP900426-0135,26,14,``It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause''.
AP900426-0135,27,31,"The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk."
AP900426-0135,28,19,"Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite."
AP900426-0135,29,3,"``Good morning, Discovery."
AP900426-0135,30,12,"I guess you're awake after that song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator."
AP900426-0135,31,9,``There are a lot of happy people down here.
AP900426-0135,32,16,We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep''.
AP900426-0135,33,12,"``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver."
AP900426-0135,34,35,"After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble."
AP900426-0135,35,22,"``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday."
AP900426-0135,36,18,"``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done,'' replied Mission Control."
AP900426-0135,37,6,``Galileo is real proud of you''.
AP900426-0135,38,31,Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
AP900426-0135,39,27,"Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands."
AP900426-0135,40,23,"The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900426-0135,41,21,"Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900426-0135,42,8,Data will follow in a month or two.
AP900426-0135,43,23,"If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it."
AP900426-0135,44,23,Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.
AP900426-0135,45,25,"``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he said."
AP900426-0135,46,9,Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.
AP900426-0135,47,25,"On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay."
AP900426-0135,48,28,"One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge."
AP900426-0135,49,8,But there was trouble with the second panel.
AP900426-0135,50,21,"It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again."
AP900426-0135,51,11,The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt.
AP900426-0135,52,33,"By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call."
AP900426-0135,53,9,Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
AP900426-0135,54,18,"The 8-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown."
AP900426-0135,55,15,The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
AP900426-0135,56,32,"Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth."
AP900426-0135,57,18,"They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago."
AP900426-0135,58,19,The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
AP900426-0135,59,18,"Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif ."
AP900428-0022,10,33,The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.
AP900428-0022,11,37,"``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery."
AP900428-0022,12,16,The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan.
AP900428-0022,13,17,"After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory."
AP900428-0022,14,24,"``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute."
AP900428-0022,15,15,"The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles."
AP900428-0022,16,26,"``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe,'' McAfee said."
AP900428-0022,17,11,``We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing''.
AP900428-0022,18,33,"The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego."
AP900428-0022,19,25,"Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement."
AP900428-0022,20,24,"``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy,'' the institute said."
AP900428-0022,21,34,"During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly."
AP900428-0022,22,21,"``This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding,'' the institute said."
AP900428-0022,23,23,"Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the ``big bang,'' an estimated 15 billion years ago."
AP900428-0022,24,20,"The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move."
AP900428-0022,25,10,The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it .
AP900428-0050,11,34,"The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations."
AP900428-0050,12,19,"``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope."
AP900428-0050,13,22,"He said the telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing."
AP900428-0050,14,26,"Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight."
AP900428-0050,15,35,"Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe."
AP900428-0050,16,19,"``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden."
AP900428-0050,17,7,``It makes little kids' eyes light up.
AP900428-0050,18,15,It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science''.
AP900428-0050,19,33,"The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite."
AP900428-0050,20,13,The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground.
AP900428-0050,21,39,"Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly."
AP900428-0050,22,12,"``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he said."
AP900428-0050,23,33,"Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed."
AP900428-0050,24,16,"``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode,'' he said."
AP900428-0050,25,42,"Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health."
AP900428-0050,26,32,"It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier."
AP900428-0050,27,18,"``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday."
AP900428-0050,28,9,``This is not the time to do anything dumb''.
AP900428-0050,29,26,"The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule."
AP900428-0050,30,25,"Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather."
AP900428-0050,31,14,Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
AP900428-0050,32,11,Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.
AP900428-0050,33,17,"The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said."
AP900428-0050,34,17,"Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, ``Cosmos''."
AP900428-0050,35,14,"``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver."
AP900428-0050,36,22,"``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield."
AP900428-0050,37,17,The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.
AP900428-0050,38,17,They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.
AP900428-0050,39,28,Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.
AP900428-0050,40,23,The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
AP900428-0050,41,25,Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
AP900428-0050,42,24,"But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time."
AP900428-0050,43,20,"Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line."
AP900428-0050,44,27,"The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard."
AP900428-0050,45,21,"A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions."
AP900428-0050,46,9,There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.
AP900428-0050,47,31,"Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said."
AP900428-0050,48,23,"NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900428-0050,49,12,But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.
AP900428-0050,50,9,Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
AP900428-0050,51,32,"The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe."
AP900428-0050,52,17,The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
AP900428-0050,53,10,Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
AP900428-0050,54,26,"He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away ."
LA042290-0160,9,22,Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit .
LA042290-0160,10,18,Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight .
LA042290-0160,11,10,Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m.
LA042290-0160,12,34,"The ship's five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit ."
LA042290-0160,13,9,"""We're off and running,"" NASA spokesman George Diller said."
LA042290-0160,14,8,"""We're still 80% go for launch weather-wise"" ."
LA042290-0160,15,19,"With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission ."
LA042290-0160,16,32,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on a pad 1.7 miles away ."
LA042290-0160,17,15,Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today.
LA042290-0160,18,25,"Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch ."
LA042290-0160,19,29,"Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch the telescope Wednesday ."
LA042290-0160,20,26,"Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, one day ahead of schedule ."

LA042590-0135,9,29,The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe .
LA042590-0135,10,46,"The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye ."
LA042590-0135,11,30,"Seven years behind schedule, the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven Hawley, an astronomer, on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see ."
LA042590-0135,12,25,"""It's been long and frustrating,"" conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by the launch ."
LA042590-0135,13,10,"""Every astronomer,"" he said softly, ""should take today off"" ."
LA042590-0135,14,21,The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the exploration of the universe .
LA042590-0135,15,23,"""After 12 years,"" astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh, ""it has finally left the Earth"" ."
LA042590-0135,16,26,"High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth today."
LA042590-0135,17,18,The telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a seven-month checkout and engineering period.
LA042590-0135,18,17,Then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe .
LA042590-0135,19,19,"After the deployment, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope."
LA042590-0135,20,31,"Although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months, there will be a few teasers early on ."
LA042590-0135,21,39,"In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture -- what astronomers call ""first light"" for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much."
LA042590-0135,22,30,"The image, of a cluster of stars in the southern sky, will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase, so it may not even be in focus ."
LA042590-0135,23,9,But it will still represent a historic moment .
LA042590-0135,24,24,"""The stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts,"" said Caltech's James Westphal, principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera."
LA042590-0135,25,11,"""But however it comes out, it's going to be great"" ."
LA042590-0135,26,23,It will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from Earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity.
LA042590-0135,27,21,"There will be other space telescopes in the years ahead, but there will never be another moment quite like this ."
LA042590-0135,28,40,"""Every bit of 12 years was worth it,"" Weiler said moments after Discovery lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future ."
LA042590-0135,29,16,"Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch."
LA042590-0135,30,35,"They were here two weeks ago, but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes, and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to Cape Canaveral ."
LA042590-0135,31,20,Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 made it back for Tuesday's launch.
LA042590-0135,32,22,Among the missing were most of the families who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history .
LA042590-0135,33,26,"There was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically, halting the countdown at 31 seconds before launch."
LA042590-0135,34,23,"The valve was ordered by computer to correct its position, and it did so, clearing the way for the countdown to resume ."
LA042590-0135,35,7,That delayed the launch about four minutes.
LA042590-0135,36,23,"But at 5:34 a.m. PDT, with Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, 45, sitting in the commander's seat, the shuttle lifted off ."
LA042590-0135,37,11,All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights.
LA042590-0135,38,24,"This is the second flight for Charles F. Bolden Jr., 43, the pilot, and mission specialists Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38."
LA042590-0135,39,9,"It is the third flight for Hawley, 38 ."
LA042590-0135,40,23,Sullivan and McCandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope.
LA042590-0135,41,23,"The most anxious moments will come as Hawley gently lifts the 25,000-pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay ."
LA042590-0135,42,19,"He will do that with the shuttle's robotic arm, which he tested in the first hours of the flight."
LA042590-0135,43,31,"The arm, however, tends to drift slightly, so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it ."
LA042590-0135,44,14,Engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope's two giant solar arrays are unfurled.
LA042590-0135,45,47,"The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged ."
LA042590-0135,46,19,So Sullivan and McCandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl the solar arrays if necessary .
LA042590-0135,47,27,"After the telescope is released and functioning on its own, the Discovery will back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days."
LA042590-0135,48,27,"If anything goes wrong during that period, the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and McCandless and Sullivan can go out and work on the problem ."
LA042590-0135,49,19,"If there are no problems, Discovery will land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base ."

LA042590-0152,10,31,"The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk ."
LA042590-0152,11,28,"The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles -- high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telescopes ."
LA042590-0152,12,14,"""Discovery, go for Hubble release,"" Mission Control told the crew at 12:37 p.m. PDT."
LA042590-0152,13,31,"The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope, glinting in the sunlight, drifted off on its 15-year search for new worlds ."
LA042590-0152,14,27,The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments .
LA042590-0152,15,13,The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
LA042590-0152,16,16,Mission Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.
LA042590-0152,17,11,"But there was a third try, and it was successful ."
LA042590-0152,18,23,"""We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed,"" the telescope control center in Maryland said ."
LA042590-0152,19,14,"""So we have good news,"" said Dave Drachlis of the Hubble control center ."
LA042590-0152,20,27,"The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their eight-hour charge ."
LA042590-0152,21,38,"Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries ."
LA042590-0152,22,38,Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed .
LA042590-0152,23,21,The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed 380 miles above South America's eastern coast.
LA042590-0152,24,17,"It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge ."
LA042590-0152,25,9,"Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome."
LA042590-0152,26,21,"It refused to budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again."
LA042590-0152,27,11,A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way .
LA042590-0152,28,10,"""Houston, we see motion,"" Commander Loren J. Shriver reported ."
LA042590-0152,29,35,Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 4 a.m. PDT when he grasped the Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12 1/2-ton telescope high above the shuttle .
LA042590-0152,30,15,"Discovery was 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown."
LA042590-0152,31,17,The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere .
LA042590-0152,32,9,Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view .
LA042590-0152,33,34,"""I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer -- something to the effect that the big marble (Earth) sure looks far away today,"" Shriver said of Hawley ."

AP880808-0040,7,37,"John Lennon spent much of a three-year span tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain Beatle."
AP880808-0040,8,39,"An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono."
AP880808-0040,9,16,The book is scheduled to be published later this month by William Morrow & Co. Inc.
AP880808-0040,10,12,"Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon ``could not be more remote''."
AP880808-0040,11,27,"Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, Sean, ``Lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent''."
AP880808-0040,12,23,"The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection."
AP880808-0040,13,24,"The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, Goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat Beatle'."
AP880808-0040,14,17,'' ``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed''.
AP880808-0040,15,19,"Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book."
AP880808-0040,16,12,"The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979."
AP880808-0040,17,5,She reportedly snorted the drug.
AP880808-0040,18,15,"According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of LSD."
AP880808-0040,19,13,"``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes Lennon as saying."
AP880808-0040,20,9,``I just ate it all the time like candy''.
AP880808-0040,21,27,"Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered eight years ago in New York ."
AP880915-0066,9,32,"A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast."
AP880915-0066,10,9,``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.
AP880915-0066,11,7,I don't see John in there ...
AP880915-0066,12,26,"It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman."
AP880915-0066,13,31,"The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife."
AP880915-0066,14,19,"As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death."
AP880915-0066,15,30,"Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon."
AP880915-0066,16,27,"Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes."
AP880915-0066,17,25,"``It's totally fiction,'' Yoko said during the hour-long program, which opened with Lennon's song, ``Gimme Some Truth,'' and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday."
AP880915-0066,18,8,``These people in this book are not us.
AP880915-0066,19,7,"It's not John and me,'' Ono continued."
AP880915-0066,20,9,``It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit back.
AP880915-0066,21,23,... For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to''.
AP880915-0066,22,23,"The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean."
AP880915-0066,23,14,"Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8, 1980."
AP880915-0066,24,28,The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available.
AP880915-0066,25,9,"Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian."
AP880915-0066,26,27,"Ono was interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _ a charge Mintz denied during the show."
AP880915-0066,27,15,"``It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies, untruths ..."
AP880915-0066,28,19,"The whole thing is just sickening,'' said Julian, who also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father."
AP880915-0066,29,17,"Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to the allegations point by point."
AP880915-0066,30,31,"She denied that Lennon was homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard Hughes."
AP880915-0066,31,21,"She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a $5,000-a-week habit."
AP880915-0066,32,33,"The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book."
AP880915-0066,33,25,"After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the Lennons' life."
AP880915-0066,34,7,Results were not expected until later today.
AP880915-0066,35,23,"Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon book, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley ."
AP880921-0201,12,28,"When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono."
AP880921-0201,13,10,"``She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her."
AP880921-0201,14,20,"I sent her a sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in rock's greatest love story."
AP880921-0201,15,10,"... I told her, `I'm in your corner,''' Goldman recalled."
AP880921-0201,16,3,Ono never responded.
AP880921-0201,17,21,"And after 1,200 interviews and 6 years, the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great altered."
AP880921-0201,18,34,"Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst: a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of rock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time."
AP880921-0201,19,35,"That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson."
AP880921-0201,20,7,``It doesn't pay to meet your idols.
AP880921-0201,21,11,"Just enjoy them; don't try to see the reality,'' Goldman said."
AP880921-0201,22,8,``My books are a cold dose of reality.
AP880921-0201,23,12,"You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes cold''."
AP880921-0201,24,32,"Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul McCartney."
AP880921-0201,25,16,"``My books are bad for business,'' Goldman said in a phone interview from Munich, West Germany."
AP880921-0201,26,17,"``They're bad for Paul's business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock business."
AP880921-0201,27,6,Those people have to hate me''.
AP880921-0201,28,9,"Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said."
AP880921-0201,29,13,"For example, he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland in 1965."
AP880921-0201,30,6,``John was very hooked into Elvis.
AP880921-0201,31,8,"Elvis was his measure of success,'' said Goldman."
AP880921-0201,32,6,``And the myth of Elvis: awesome.
AP880921-0201,33,7,But the reality of Elvis: a mess''.
AP880921-0201,34,30,"Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney, Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations."
AP880921-0201,35,7,``You can't say John lacks for defenders.
AP880921-0201,36,4,And Yoko isn't dead.
AP880921-0201,37,6,Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead.
AP880921-0201,38,10,Ninety-five percent of the people in my books aren't dead.
AP880921-0201,39,11,"They can do something about it,'' said Goldman, his voice quickening."
AP880921-0201,40,11,``This business of making it easy for defending myself is insane.
AP880921-0201,41,7,I'm the target of scores of attacks.
AP880921-0201,42,9,I can't imagine a harder thing for an author''.
AP880921-0201,43,21,"Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said."
AP880921-0201,44,9,``A lot of people already made up their minds.
AP880921-0201,45,28,"They hear Albert Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality _ bang, let him have it! I resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including Yoko,'' the author said."
AP880921-0201,46,11,Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the book.
AP880921-0201,47,24,"She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons ``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and 12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography."
AP880921-0201,48,23,"``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries,'' said Goldman, who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show."
AP880921-0201,49,4,``She takes no chances.
AP880921-0201,50,5,This was another no-chance Yoko''.
AP880921-0201,51,36,"As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness, Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him."
AP880921-0201,52,9,``My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind.
AP880921-0201,53,7,"Every yin had a yang,'' said Goldman."
AP880921-0201,54,14,``There is nothing more natural than for John to try the other side (sexually).
AP880921-0201,55,8,That's just the kind of guy he was.
AP880921-0201,56,6,He wanted to try everything once.''

AP881007-0207,15,3,NEW YORK (AP)
AP881007-0207,16,17,"Watching the new movie, ``Imagine: John Lennon,'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono."
AP881007-0207,17,25,"``The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said."
AP881007-0207,18,14,"Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by Ono."
AP881007-0207,19,20,"She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture."
AP881007-0207,20,19,"Andrew Solt (``This Is Elvis'') directed, Solt and David L. Wolper produced and Solt and Sam Egan wrote it."
AP881007-0207,21,17,"``I think this is really the definitive documentary of John Lennon's life,'' Ono said in an interview."
AP881007-0207,22,15,"``What John was really about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without whitewashing."
AP881007-0207,23,4,``I did view it.
AP881007-0207,24,8,I didn't have them take any footage out.
AP881007-0207,25,4,``I wanted the truth.
AP881007-0207,26,22,In the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration.
AP881007-0207,27,11,I think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so''.
AP881007-0207,28,25,"There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by Lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title ."
AP881007-0207,29,25,``Imagine there's no heaven ``It's easy if you try ``No hell below us ``Above us only sky ``Imagine all the people ``Living for today. ...''
AP881007-0207,30,7,``Imagine'' is more than a Lennon elegy.
AP881007-0207,31,36,"Though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles (drug use, abusive tempers, manager Brian Epstein's death), it does capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived."
AP881007-0207,32,33,"One intriguing episode in ``Imagine'' shows cartoonist Al Capp (``L'il Abner'') being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace."
AP881007-0207,33,5,"``We were naive,'' Ono said."
AP881007-0207,34,9,``A lot of things happened because we were naive.
AP881007-0207,35,5,Maybe that was our strength.
AP881007-0207,36,21,"To us, Al Capp was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with a sense of humor."
AP881007-0207,37,4,We didn't expect hostility.
AP881007-0207,38,8,``Al Capp is one incident that was filmed.
AP881007-0207,39,14,In those days we did numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace.
AP881007-0207,40,7,... There were some very rough interviews.
AP881007-0207,41,15,The hostility that was shown to us bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible.
AP881007-0207,42,7,"Each time, I think we were hurt''."
AP881007-0207,43,11,Ono said Lennon wrote the song ``Imagine'' in 1969 or '70.
AP881007-0207,44,12,"``We did the bed-in, the Toronto Peace Festival, the `War's Over' billboard."
AP881007-0207,45,14,He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace.
AP881007-0207,46,16,I think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds.''
AP881007-0207,47,28,``Imagine there's no countries ``It isn't hard to do ``Nothing to kill or die for ``And no religion too ``Imagine all the people ``Living life in peace ...
AP881007-0207,48,24,``You may say i'm a dreamer ``But i'm not the only one ``i hope someday you'll join us ``and the world be as one.''
AP881007-0207,49,6,"Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940."
AP881007-0207,50,13,"He was shot and killed outside his Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980."
AP881007-0207,51,8,Ono was a painter when Lennon met her.
AP881007-0207,52,12,She later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace.
AP881007-0207,53,35,"``I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of events that I'm known as a widow,'' she said."
AP881007-0207,54,13,``But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it.
AP881007-0207,55,36,I think that John promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him.
AP881007-0207,56,10,... I think it is my turn to promote him.

AP881007-0207,58,28,"When Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' was published in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices, faults and neuroses, Ono called it ``totally fiction''."
AP881007-0207,59,13,Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans.
AP881007-0207,60,20,"``I was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly."
AP881007-0207,61,4,I really appreciate that.
AP881007-0207,62,15,I was also surprised that so many people stood up against it (the Goldman book).
AP881007-0207,63,6,"I didn't expect that,'' Ono said."
AP881007-0207,64,15,"Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, also has written a new book, ``John Lennon, My Brother''."
AP881007-0207,65,22,She has no idea how many books have been written about Lennon; she's been sent some of them but hasn't read them.
AP881007-0207,66,14,``I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody else's version''.
AP881007-0207,67,18,"There's still enough footage, Ono said, for another movie _ perhaps a music or political or art film."
AP881007-0207,68,10,And there's another big John Lennon project on her horizon.
AP881007-0207,69,11,``It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway musical.

AP890119-0266,11,24,"The image of a dour, shoeless English boy and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey Giuliano to collaborate on a book."
AP890119-0266,12,15,"The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's half-brother and Giuliano's idol."
AP890119-0266,13,20,"But the neglected urchin and his live-it-up mother _ who was also Baird's mother _ never existed, the authors say."
AP890119-0266,14,17,"``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John, and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy'!"
AP890119-0266,15,36,"That's not my brother, that's not my mother, that's not my children's grandmother,'' said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and his Liverpool roots."
AP890119-0266,16,30,"Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother'' was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo."
AP890119-0266,17,9,"The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two different motives."
AP890119-0266,18,8,Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon.
AP890119-0266,19,16,"Baird wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose name also was Julia."
AP890119-0266,20,29,"The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics."
AP890119-0266,21,33,"Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi, Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother."
AP890119-0266,22,8,"``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird."
AP890119-0266,23,16,"``I wanted to set the record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John."
AP890119-0266,24,11,I feel my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press''.
AP890119-0266,25,22,"Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John Dykins."
AP890119-0266,26,24,"She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins _ and big brother John."
AP890119-0266,27,28,"The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with Julia."
AP890119-0266,28,54,"It tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage."
AP890119-0266,29,17,"But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart, had a loving relationship."
AP890119-0266,30,21,The book got its start after Baird watched a British television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
AP890119-0266,31,14,"The show presented Julia ``as an unfit mother, no mother at all,'' Baird said."
AP890119-0266,32,9,Baird complained and was urged to tell her story.
AP890119-0266,33,11,She wrote an essay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool.
AP890119-0266,34,17,"Then she met Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``The Beatles: A Celebration''."
AP890119-0266,35,24,"Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with Baird in England."
AP890119-0266,36,10,"While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to McCartney."
AP890119-0266,37,13,"He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword for the book."
AP890119-0266,38,17,"With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family album than a biography."
AP890119-0266,39,27,"Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician."
AP890119-0266,40,16,"However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child's recollections of an aspiring brother."
AP890119-0266,41,34,"After Julia was killed in a traffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losing contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the United States."
AP890119-0266,42,29,"The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80."
AP890119-0266,43,24,Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early years.
AP890119-0266,44,11,"``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said."
AP890119-0266,45,19,"``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door saying, `Write your story, name your price'."
AP890119-0266,46,6,We quickly showed them the door''.
AP890119-0266,47,24,"Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography, ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as Baird's book."
AP890119-0266,48,26,"Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer."
AP890119-0266,49,21,"``I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and I knew what the tone would be,'' Baird said."
AP890119-0266,50,15,"``Most people, including Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong''."
AP890119-0266,51,3,Giuliano was harsher.
AP890119-0266,52,12,"``Goldman was in it for the money from day one,'' Giuliano said."
AP890119-0266,53,10,"``Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough."
AP890119-0266,54,4,So what's his motive?
AP890119-0266,55,11,If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most dough''.
AP890119-0266,56,10,Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing.
AP890119-0266,57,15,"She agreed to change the title from ``My Brother John'' to ``John Lennon, My Brother''."
AP890119-0266,58,23,"The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specs also help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books."
AP890119-0266,59,18,"They're on the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennon inherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said."
AP890119-0266,60,17,The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a brother whose art touched millions.
AP890119-0266,61,7,"``It's not a major biography,'' Giuliano said."
AP890119-0266,62,16,"``This book is a little slice out of a big pie, out of a big life."

AP901121-0207,12,31,Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
AP901121-0207,13,22,"Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas."
AP901121-0207,14,24,"But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono."
AP901121-0207,15,7,It was more than a superstar session.
AP901121-0207,16,12,"Afterall, Lennon gave no press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts."
AP901121-0207,17,22,Rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard Garbo'').
AP901121-0207,18,25,"Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players."
AP901121-0207,19,11,Recording was to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
AP901121-0207,20,10,"To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero."
AP901121-0207,21,11,He didn't know him and was nervous about working with him.
AP901121-0207,22,21,"The drummer guessed he was something like the intense, irreverent young man of the movies ``Help''! and ``A Hard Day's Night''."
AP901121-0207,23,7,Lennon was those things - and more.
AP901121-0207,24,31,"``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon,'' said Newmark, who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry."
AP901121-0207,25,15,``His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the stories and images we had created.
AP901121-0207,26,11,I didn't see anything that seemed startlingly new to the myth.
AP901121-0207,27,20,"It just appeared to be what we had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend people''."
AP901121-0207,28,26,"Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and Honey,'' Lennon's final albums."
AP901121-0207,29,10,"It was the ``best experience of my life,'' he insisted."
AP901121-0207,30,5,``The highlight of my career''.
AP901121-0207,31,4,The nerves quickly settled.
AP901121-0207,32,19,"Once recording began, Lennon was just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album."
AP901121-0207,33,12,The music was mostly mainstream pop; no 18-minute jams or political anthems.
AP901121-0207,34,10,"``I hate all that fancy stuff,'' Lennon told his drummer."
AP901121-0207,35,5,"``Keep it simple, like Ringo''."
AP901121-0207,36,18,"He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher, sweeter than on earlier albums."
AP901121-0207,37,19,"Lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production lush."
AP901121-0207,38,12,``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his wife.
AP901121-0207,39,7,``Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)'' was for Sean.
AP901121-0207,40,32,"Lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time,'' capping the line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet''."
AP901121-0207,41,11,"Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played host."
AP901121-0207,42,6,Sushi was the food of choice.
AP901121-0207,43,8,"The strongest drug was Brazilian coffee, freshly ground."
AP901121-0207,44,13,"``Guys, I'm taking off,'' Lennon would say as he poured himself another cup."
AP901121-0207,45,16,"And there were plenty of stories about the Beatles - the ``B's,'' as John called them."
AP901121-0207,46,25,"Reunions were out of the question, a return to adolescence in his opinion, but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high."
AP901121-0207,47,21,"``By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it,'' Newmark said."
AP901121-0207,48,14,"``When he talked about the `B's,' it was as if it was his band."
AP901121-0207,49,5,He was the spiritual leader.
AP901121-0207,50,8,I felt that a lot through the sessions''.
AP901121-0207,51,24,"By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio."
AP901121-0207,52,9,But he had planned on working with him again.
AP901121-0207,53,21,"``Milk and Honey'' was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to tour, using many of the same musicians."
AP901121-0207,54,13,"``Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans,'' Lennon once sang."
AP901121-0207,55,36,"It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennon's murder the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didn't even feel like working for the next few years - everything else suddenly seemed ``second rate''."
AP901121-0207,56,13,"Newmark never listens to the record, but still hears ``Woman'' on the radio."
AP901121-0207,57,29,"When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories."
AP901121-0207,58,19,No one had a reason to remember all that at the time; those weren't supposed to be farewell sessions.
AP901121-0207,59,28,"``When I looked in his eyes, I felt a tremendous depth of character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition, a tremendous amount of compassion,,'' Newmark said."

AP901208-0076,22,28,Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a period when he had ``gone off the rails'' and his relationship with Ms. Ono had suffered.

SJMN91-06231192,19,7,Acceptance is a difficult concept for her.
SJMN91-06231192,20,27,"""I'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it,"" Ono says during a telephone interview."
SJMN91-06231192,21,21,"She's speaking from the New York office of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image."

SJMN91-06231192,52,10,There has been much speculation on Ono and Lennon's relationship.

SJMN91-06231192,55,39,"""There was no way to dominate him, even if I wanted to.""; Others say Lennon used his relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him -- such as the Beatles."
SJMN91-06231192,56,29,"In May 1968, when the Beatles came together at the studio to work on ""The Beatles,"" the two-record set commonly called ""The White Album,"" Ono was at Lennon's side."
SJMN91-06231192,57,4,The two were inseparable.
SJMN91-06231192,58,16,"According to at least one Beatles biographer, Ono even accompanied Lennon on trips to the bathroom."
SJMN91-06231192,59,15,The relationship between the Beatles -- especially Lennon and Paul McCartney -- was already strained.
SJMN91-06231192,60,15,"Having Ono in the studio, offering suggestions and backing Lennon up in arguments, didn't help."
SJMN91-06231192,61,26,"Still, the group already seemed headed toward a break-up, which finally came when McCartney sued the other Beatles to resolve an argument over the group's management."
SJMN91-06231192,62,8,"So, no, Ono didn't break up the Beatles."
SJMN91-06231192,63,12,But it's also true that three of them didn't like her much.
SJMN91-06231192,64,20,"Life after John; ""I think the very fact that John and I got together hurt them a lot,"" she says."

SJMN91-06231192,72,4,"""It varies,"" she says."
SJMN91-06231192,73,16,"""Sometimes they are friendly, sometimes they are not . . . like all relationships with friends."
SJMN91-06231192,74,29,"I think that's natural.""; Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have been painful to Ono."

WSJ881021-0008,4,34,"Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, ""The Lives of John Lennon"" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger."
WSJ881021-0008,5,46,"Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia."
WSJ881021-0008,6,38,"The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions."
WSJ881021-0008,7,4,"A can't-miss formula, surely."
WSJ881021-0008,8,10,Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre was Elvis Presley.
WSJ881021-0008,9,17,"Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr."
WSJ881021-0008,10,2,Goldman's methods.
WSJ881021-0008,11,34,"His title notwithstanding, the ""King of Rock 'n' Roll"" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by P.R. wizards, was ripe for debunking."
WSJ881021-0008,12,19,"But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable."
WSJ881021-0008,13,7,"For apart from his puerile politics, Mr."
WSJ881021-0008,14,30,"Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on."
WSJ881021-0008,15,18,"By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad."
WSJ881021-0008,16,16,His public loved him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all.
WSJ881021-0008,17,22,Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery (quaint terms)! were losing their social sting.
WSJ881021-0008,18,15,"His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything."
WSJ881021-0008,19,21,"And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject."
WSJ881021-0008,20,4,The leitmotif of Mr.
WSJ881021-0008,21,28,"Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity."
WSJ881021-0008,22,15,Now Mr. Goldman is here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it.
WSJ881021-0008,23,65,"Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the ""scoops"" that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, ""West 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit."
WSJ881021-0008,24,13,"The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page."
WSJ881021-0008,25,8,"Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art has triumphed: Mr."
WSJ881021-0008,26,11,Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon.
WSJ881021-0008,27,37,"A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth."
WSJ881021-0008,28,22,"Mr. Goldman, alas, allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well."
WSJ881021-0008,29,15,The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out.
WSJ881021-0008,30,23,"Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities, they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds."
WSJ881021-0008,31,34,"And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic."
WSJ881021-0008,32,29,"Criticizing ""The Lives of John Lennon"" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners."
WSJ881021-0008,33,10,"The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged."
WSJ881021-0008,34,20,But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr.
WSJ881021-0008,35,2,Goldman's book.
WSJ881021-0008,36,35,"There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as ""pieces,"" as though they were concerti."
WSJ881021-0008,37,19,"There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drugs, sex, music -- that gives him license to second-guess Mr."
WSJ881021-0008,38,3,Lennon's every move.
WSJ881021-0008,39,47,"And there is the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped over lightly because -- there goes the advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light."
WSJ881021-0008,40,54,"All of which indicates why ""The Lives of John Lennon"" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad."
WSJ881021-0008,41,18,"John Lennon, while he was alive, did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites."
WSJ881021-0008,42,12,--- Mr. Ferguson is assistant managing editor of The American Spectator .

AP890616-0230,36,22,"Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout."

AP890719-0248,23,33,Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.
AP890719-0248,24,17,He blamed some of the miners' discontent on ``anti-socialist'' elements but said he understood their basic demands.
AP890719-0248,25,39,"Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most of the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime, but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle, and the miners are refusing any delay, he said."
AP890719-0248,26,14,Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more control over their industry.
AP890719-0248,27,35,"If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, ``We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing,'' Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take."
AP890719-0248,28,22,He said the lost coal production could not be recovered by increasing the mines' output because they already work at full capacity.
AP890719-0248,29,26,"Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the number appeared to be rising."

AP890720-0075,17,33,"Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions."
AP890720-0075,18,29,"Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s."

FBIS4-42027,14,9,The strike continued at these mines on 28 June.
FBIS4-42027,15,18,"Some of the miners at the Karl Marx, ""Chernovonyy Zhovten,"" ""Chervonyy Profinter,"" and ""Yunkom"" pits joined the strike."
FBIS4-42027,16,12,"A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike."
FBIS4-42027,17,34,"A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" production association."
FBIS4-42027,18,44,A strike committee consisting of 12 persons was elected (one of the members is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it was decided to continue the strike until the demands that had been raised have been completely fulfilled.
FBIS4-42027,19,38,"On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the ""PivdennoDonbass"" mine of the ""Donetskvuhillya"" production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons -- delay in paying wages."

FBIS4-42027,21,28,"On 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the ""Karbomid"" and ""Pervomaysk"" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to start work (142 and 157 miners respectively)."
FBIS4-42027,22,40,"In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections."
FBIS4-42027,23,21,"According to some reports, among the leaders of the striking pits there are members of the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms."

FT923-12122,7,34,"WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies."
FT923-12122,8,39,"The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent."
FT923-12122,9,24,"Further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups."
FT923-12122,10,43,Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
FT923-12122,11,33,"In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit."
FT923-12122,12,26,"The industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some 12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output."
FT923-12122,13,19,"This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest."
FT923-12122,14,26,Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last year.

FT933-9536,7,28,"COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages."
FT933-9536,8,12,"But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in."
FT933-9536,9,18,"It has instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its second week, declared illegal."
FT933-9536,10,5,The miners' position seems untenable.
FT933-9536,11,24,"Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month."
FT933-9536,12,7,Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
FT933-9536,13,20,Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
FT933-9536,14,28,The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy.
FT933-9536,15,32,"The region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity, could also be run using lignite and gas."
FT933-9536,16,18,The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market.
FT933-9536,17,18,"According to the ministry, if the miners' pay demands were met, the cost of their coal would double."
FT933-9536,18,13,"Even at present prices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market."
FT933-9536,19,9,The strike seems motivated by a number of factors.
FT933-9536,20,24,The rank and file have come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult conditions in which they live and work.
FT933-9536,21,28,"They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases."
FT933-9536,22,26,"Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious."
FT933-9536,23,24,The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company officials.
FT933-9536,24,14,"The company's chief accountant and budget director have already been fired, following earlier investigations."
FT933-9536,25,17,Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to divert attention from the investigations.
FT933-9536,26,5,"Mr Cosma, however, appears confident."
FT933-9536,27,13,"One of his bargaining tools is the threat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence."
FT933-9536,28,30,"In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'With miners, anything is possible'."
FT933-9536,29,7,But he is also making political threats.
FT933-9536,30,31,"In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power."
FT933-9536,31,13,Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met.
FT933-9536,32,23,It remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991 now feel confident enough to ignore him .

SJMN91-06069108,10,11,The strike is the new union's first major test of strength.
SJMN91-06069108,11,33,It began March 1 as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and the Krasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's major coal regions.

SJMN91-06069108,16,12,"First, he said, they want ""real sovereignty"" for the 15 Soviet republics."

SJMN91-06069108,19,29,"Finally, the union wants a ""law on property"" that would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of land and industry, including some mines, he said."
SJMN91-06069108,20,36,"According to the state news agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetsk coal basin of western Siberia ."

AP880817-0040,13,27,The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
AP880817-0040,14,24,Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life.
AP880817-0040,15,28,"Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period."
AP880817-0040,16,32,"``One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit,'' said Indianapolis attorney William R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign."
AP880817-0040,17,10,``He's the same nice guy he was in law school''.
AP880817-0040,18,31,"Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s."
AP880817-0040,19,31,"Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind., before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in 1970."
AP880817-0040,20,21,"Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him."
AP880817-0040,21,23,"``I think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are even after this,'' said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle's 1986 campaign."
AP880817-0040,22,24,Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.
AP880817-0040,23,30,"``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,'' said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute."
AP880817-0040,24,4,``It's a beautiful family.
AP880817-0040,25,7,I think they'll be a real asset''.
AP880817-0040,26,20,"The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne."
AP880817-0040,27,29,"When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in two groups _ the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinne and her father visiting county fairs."
AP880817-0040,28,9,"``The kids are nonchalant, normal kids,'' said Mrs. Saddler."
AP880817-0040,29,7,``They take it in stride and play''.
AP880817-0040,30,28,"In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family's loss of privacy during a national campaign."
AP880817-0040,31,16,"``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,'' said Mrs. Quayle, 39."
AP880817-0040,32,22,Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.
AP880817-0040,33,8,"Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said."
AP880817-0040,34,22,"Benjamin was ambiguous but he thought Secret Service agents might be able to help him on tests at school, Mrs. Quayle said."
AP880817-0040,35,17,"Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home, Quayle said."
AP880817-0040,36,15,"``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob Dole,''' said Quayle ."
AP880818-0023,9,23,Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
AP880818-0023,10,32,"Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, ``I'd say, `there stands the next Thomas Jefferson'''."
AP880818-0023,11,20,"And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia''."
AP880818-0023,12,11,"Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat."
AP880818-0023,13,24,"``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said Ford."
AP880818-0023,14,22,``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years''.
AP880818-0023,15,8,What Quayle thinks of those references isn't known.
AP880818-0023,16,15,But he doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert Redford.
AP880818-0023,17,15,"Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder."
AP880818-0023,18,8,"In the parlance of politics, it's an issue."
AP880818-0023,19,4,They are both male.
AP880818-0023,20,4,They are both blond.
AP880818-0023,21,17,The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage.
AP880818-0023,22,31,"The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The Candidate'' sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature."
AP880818-0023,23,23,"Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself."
AP880818-0023,24,14,"And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-called Redford look ``a stigma''."
AP880818-0023,25,14,He wasn't asked how he felt about being painted as another Jefferson or Kennedy.
AP880818-0023,26,19,"Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who, at 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend."
AP880818-0023,27,20,"He is a Republican vice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said of himself, a household word."
AP880818-0023,28,18,"To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him."
AP880818-0023,29,8,"``We know him well,'' said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C."
AP880818-0023,30,17,"``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz."
AP880818-0023,31,34,"``I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M."
AP880818-0023,32,15,"Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not hold him back."
AP880818-0023,33,13,"``Let's not start this business of who's wealthy,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y ."
AP880818-0226,6,30,Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
AP880818-0226,7,2,Thank you.
AP880818-0226,8,2,Thank you.
AP880818-0226,9,24,"Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States."
AP880818-0226,10,32,"We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle."
AP880818-0226,11,8,"You know, senators get a lot of mail."
AP880818-0226,12,5,Party leaders more than most.
AP880818-0226,13,13,And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem.
AP880818-0226,14,27,"Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem."
AP880818-0226,15,11,"She wrote, and I quote: ``I have my second-grade play tonight."
AP880818-0226,16,11,Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me''.
AP880818-0226,17,17,"I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too."
AP880818-0226,18,24,"Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate."
AP880818-0226,19,12,Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family man.
AP880818-0226,20,39,"And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land."
AP880818-0226,21,28,"Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution."
AP880818-0226,22,10,And now he is ready to carry that revolution forward.
AP880818-0226,23,22,"And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign."
AP880818-0226,24,4,Just let them try.
AP880818-0226,25,11,"Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience."
AP880818-0226,26,37,"He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts."
AP880818-0226,27,17,And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
AP880818-0226,28,8,It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me.
AP880818-0226,29,6,"But Dan Quayle's got experience, too."
AP880818-0226,30,31,"He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country."
AP880818-0226,31,18,That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis _ and he is running for president.
AP880818-0226,32,15,"As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust."
AP880818-0226,33,11,"I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman."
AP880818-0226,34,28,"And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen. Dick Lugar ."

AP880819-0023,9,22,"Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight."
AP880819-0023,10,46,"Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket."
AP880819-0023,11,33,"Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration."
AP880819-0023,12,13,"``Let's go on to victory''! Quayle exhorted, as the crowd erupted in cheers."
AP880819-0023,13,29,"The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy."
AP880819-0023,14,20,"Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side''."
AP880819-0023,15,20,"The two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois."
AP880819-0023,16,18,But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.
AP880819-0023,17,2,Retired Maj.
AP880819-0023,18,46,"Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,'' the News reported."
AP880819-0023,19,18,"Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school."
AP880819-0023,20,38,"A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard."
AP880819-0023,21,18,"Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested."
AP880819-0023,22,20,Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall.
AP880819-0023,23,28,"It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor, rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of John F. Kennedy."
AP880819-0023,24,20,"Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served."
AP880819-0023,25,15,"He also addressed his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan Quayle'?"
AP880819-0023,26,11,The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will''.
AP880819-0023,27,13,Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition.
AP880819-0023,28,27,"Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job."
AP880819-0023,29,10,``He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator.
AP880819-0023,30,20,"... That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president,'' Dole said."
AP880819-0023,31,32,"Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality'' to the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign''."
AP880819-0023,32,15,Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen.
AP880819-0023,33,14,"Others, notably Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could not."
AP880819-0023,34,15,"But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be daunted by the prospect."
AP880819-0023,35,8,"``Miracles do happen,'' he told his party ."
AP880826-0226,10,28,"Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show."
AP880826-0226,11,14,"The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1."
AP880826-0226,12,18,"Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov."
AP880826-0226,13,3,Edgar D. Whitcomb.
AP880826-0226,14,29,"Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971."
AP880826-0226,15,24,"``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis."
AP880826-0226,16,7,``He was in fact the chief investigator.
AP880826-0226,17,7,He helped get the unit set up.
AP880826-0226,18,15,"(But) it would not have been before 1971,'' Smith said Friday in a telephone interview."
AP880826-0226,19,6,``We formally began operations July 1''.
AP880826-0226,20,17,Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate'' and said his staff had written the document.
AP880826-0226,21,7,"``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate."
AP880826-0226,22,15,"I didn't hold that job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane."
AP880826-0226,23,21,"Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot''."
AP880826-0226,24,32,Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard.
AP880826-0226,25,16,"Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending Indiana University Law School at the time."
AP880826-0226,26,18,"M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News, helped arrange his job interview with the state."
AP880826-0226,27,13,"Evans worked for Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News."
AP880826-0226,28,28,"``At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or use any influence,'' said Evans, now with the National Journalism Center in Washington, D.C."
AP880826-0226,29,9,``He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator.
AP880826-0226,30,19,He was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits.
AP880826-0226,31,6,"It's a nothing story,'' Evans said."
AP880826-0226,32,22,"Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak."
AP880826-0226,33,34,"Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints and inquiries were handled by me."
AP880826-0226,34,15,The legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle''.
AP880826-0226,35,8,Her statement was released by the Quayle campaign.
AP880826-0226,36,26,"The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud."
AP880826-0226,37,26,"In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran'' in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race."
AP880826-0226,38,18,"Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans."
AP880826-0226,39,23,"In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was ``on active duty for several periods during his tenure'' in the Guard."
AP880826-0226,40,19,The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer .
AP881114-0006,9,32,"Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say."
AP881114-0006,10,33,"Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies."
AP881114-0006,11,48,"Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel."
AP881114-0006,12,15,``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more.
AP881114-0006,13,18,One thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown.
AP881114-0006,14,35,"... With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals,'' said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the American presidency."
AP881114-0006,15,10,Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign.
AP881114-0006,16,36,"When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had been ``tempered by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military service, academic record and personal life."
AP881114-0006,17,21,"The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president."
AP881114-0006,18,14,But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle.
AP881114-0006,19,25,"Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts."
AP881114-0006,20,12,"``I will be a very close adviser to the president,'' Quayle said."
AP881114-0006,21,8,But that's not the way everyone sees it.
AP881114-0006,22,30,"Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns, Barilleaux notes."
AP881114-0006,23,14,``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.
AP881114-0006,24,10,He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol Hill.
AP881114-0006,25,16,"... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush,'' Barilleaux says."
AP881114-0006,26,27,"``They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside ..."
AP881114-0006,27,17,"not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a pro forma basis''."
AP881114-0006,28,33,"But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign."
AP881114-0006,29,3,``Vindication demands that.
AP881114-0006,30,14,"Both of them will want to prove how right the decision was,'' Mahe says."
AP881114-0006,31,28,"Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency."
AP881114-0006,32,12,Even some members of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.
AP881114-0006,33,34,"Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn't live in this century''."
AP881114-0006,34,20,"Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says Quayle, while ``not the world's leading intellectual,'' is not ``a complete dummy''."
AP881114-0006,35,14,"He was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared, Ornstein says."
AP881114-0006,36,4,``I think he's immature.
AP881114-0006,37,5,"He's not stupid,'' Ornstein says."
AP881114-0006,38,35,"But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate,'' Ornstein says."
AP881114-0006,39,10,``That's going to give him a good deal to overcome.
AP881114-0006,40,11,It's going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself.
AP881114-0006,41,8,"That's going to be difficult, given the office''."
AP881114-0006,42,23,Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
AP881114-0006,43,26,"The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight Eisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen as a political nonentity."
AP881114-0006,44,18,"``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixon did with Agnew in 1968,'' Hess says."
AP881114-0006,45,38,"``However, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988''."
AP881114-0006,46,8,Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process.
AP881114-0006,47,19,"After the controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man."
AP881114-0006,48,25,He became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted message.
AP881114-0006,49,7,"Soon, he dropped off the front pages."
AP881114-0006,50,36,"And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity."
AP881114-0006,51,26,``We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all.
AP881114-0006,52,9,"That's what we're supposed to be,'' he told reporters."
AP881114-0006,53,31,"That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants ``a private adviser, whose experience and opinion he respected ..."
AP881114-0006,54,6,(who) has never had another agenda''.
AP881114-0006,55,15,"``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone,'' Mahe says."
AP881114-0006,56,12,``You're never going to see Dan Quayle telling tales out of school.''
LA111289-0035,8,18,"One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull ."
LA111289-0035,9,17,His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news.
LA111289-0035,10,7,"He went on ""Meet the Press"" ."
LA111289-0035,11,5,This was no small thing.
LA111289-0035,12,17,"During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows."
LA111289-0035,13,18,"He didn't appear on ""Meet the Press"" or ""This Week With David Brinkley"" or ""Face the Nation"" ."
LA111289-0035,14,14,And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news.
LA111289-0035,15,12,"His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news ."
LA111289-0035,16,8,He was the stuff of nightly TV monologues.
LA111289-0035,17,19,"""A lot of people feel Quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job,"" Jay Leno once said ."
LA111289-0035,18,52,"That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications ."
LA111289-0035,19,22,"So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target."
LA111289-0035,20,17,Stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992 .
LA111289-0035,21,25,"""We had asked him on the show a number of times,"" Christie Basham, senior producer of ""Meet the Press"" told me, ""but he always declined."
LA111289-0035,22,22,"We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show, he changed his mind and said he would."
LA111289-0035,23,19,"It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest"" ."
LA111289-0035,24,19,"And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered ""above and beyond"" the usual guest."
LA111289-0035,25,7,"Normally, a vice president would not be."
LA111289-0035,26,8,That's because vice presidents don't actually do anything.
LA111289-0035,27,7,They don't run departments or make policy.
LA111289-0035,28,9,They mostly wait for heads of state to expire.
LA111289-0035,29,16,"As George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president: ""You die; I fly"" ."
LA111289-0035,30,13,But Quayle was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up.
LA111289-0035,31,15,He might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the President .
LA111289-0035,32,4,None of this happened.
LA111289-0035,33,4,The show was uneventful.
LA111289-0035,34,15,Quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news.
LA111289-0035,35,14,Some major newspapers didn't even bother to do a story the next day .
LA111289-0035,36,8,It was everything Quayle had hoped for .
LA111289-0035,37,20,"I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show ."
LA111289-0035,38,15,"""Well, he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job,"" Beckwith said."
LA111289-0035,39,18,"""He wanted to solidify his relationship with the President and learn the inner workings of the administration"" ."
LA111289-0035,40,5,So why go on now?
LA111289-0035,41,9,"""It seemed like a particularly opportune week,"" Beckwith said."
LA111289-0035,42,9,George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev had announced a summit.
LA111289-0035,43,7,Central America was back in the news.
LA111289-0035,44,16,"And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992 ."
LA111289-0035,45,16,"""And Marlin (Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman) called and just suggested we do the show,"" Beckwith said ."
LA111289-0035,46,20,The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush's first major (and some would say only) decision of his presidential campaign.
LA111289-0035,47,15,"He had input from a number of people, but Quayle was George Bush's choice ."
LA111289-0035,48,20,"Many thought it was a terrible choice, but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow."
LA111289-0035,49,23,"And Bush's announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush's way of saying: ""I didn't screw up the first time."
LA111289-0035,50,25,"I made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was, I am making it again"" ."
LA111289-0035,51,24,"And now was the time for Quayle to go on ""Meet the Press"" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been ."
LA111289-0035,52,15,I asked Beckwith if Quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone .
LA111289-0035,53,12,"""He was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions,"" Beckwith said."
LA111289-0035,54,14,"""A lot of the time, you never know what you're going to get into."
LA111289-0035,55,9,"Sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious"" ."
LA111289-0035,56,23,"A typical example of a ""non-serious"" question often put to Dan Quayle is: ""Why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you""?"
LA111289-0035,57,9,But Quayle got no questions like that last week.
LA111289-0035,58,19,"I asked Christie Basham of ""Meet the Press"" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be."
LA111289-0035,59,10,"""Yes,"" Basham said, ""but almost all the guests do"" ."
LA111289-0035,60,23,"Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions."
LA111289-0035,61,28,"(If Quayle had been told the questioners were going to be Hunter Thompson and Jimmy Breslin, I have a feeling Quayle might have come down with laryngitis) ."
LA111289-0035,62,21,"After the show, Fitzwater called Quayle to express his, and presumably the President's, pleasure at how Quayle had handled himself ."
LA111289-0035,63,13,Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well .
LA111289-0035,64,16,"""The very limitations of a vice president's role don't make him an ideal guest,"" Beckwith admitted."
LA111289-0035,65,15,"""Almost by job description, a vice president is not permitted to make serious news"" ."
LA111289-0035,66,10,And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that.
LA111289-0035,67,24,"During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996 ."
LA111289-0035,68,25,"And he will do so, I believe, by being a vice president who keeps his head down, his nose clean and his life dull ."
LA111289-0035,69,8,"After all, it worked for George Bush ."

SJMN91-06140099,11,42,"He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit."
SJMN91-06140099,12,33,"To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States."
SJMN91-06140099,13,9,"""We're preserving history,"" says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator."
SJMN91-06140099,14,19,"""A century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him.""; If so, Huntington will be ready."
SJMN91-06140099,15,49,"Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have donated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, a coffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote, signed or posed for."
SJMN91-06140099,16,12,"The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lock of his baby hair."
SJMN91-06140099,17,23,"The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of Quayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to the race."
SJMN91-06140099,18,18,And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she saved from one of Quayle's floors.
SJMN91-06140099,19,37,"The exhibition, which runs through May 20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president."
SJMN91-06140099,20,13,"""He has taken such a bad rap,"" said Schenkel, a foundation board member."
SJMN91-06140099,21,10,"""If people knew him, they'd see he's a regular person."
SJMN91-06140099,22,38,"If they had a chance to sit down with Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man.""; These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting ""good press"" on their man."
SJMN91-06140099,23,69,"Instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity, describing the best coverage as ""more upbeat"" or ""halfway decent.""; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 in February (""All he needs is a little seasoning""); his limited experience (""Look at what they said about Truman -- he was a haberdasher""), and his passion for golf (""He has to have some form of relaxation"")."
SJMN91-06140099,24,9,But they are careful not to stretch the superlatives.
SJMN91-06140099,25,7,"The description ""nice"" comes up a lot."
SJMN91-06140099,26,23,"""He's not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is,"" says Dottie Watson, president of the Republican Women of Huntington County."
SJMN91-06140099,27,8,"""He's a very nice person, a capable person."
SJMN91-06140099,28,22,"Everybody I know says he can do it.""; That is not to say some people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle."
SJMN91-06140099,29,38,"""If he would slow down, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't think people would take him the way they do,"" said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the owner of Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant."
SJMN91-06140099,30,32,"Hayden Schenkel, chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel, says, ""Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States."
SJMN91-06140099,31,28,"Most of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president, and they're 100 percent behind him."
SJMN91-06140099,32,26,"But in all due respect, we sure hope nothing happens to President Bush.""; Quayle has declined an invitation to attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule."
SJMN91-06140099,33,31,"Nonetheless, most of Huntington's 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from the Senate to the vice presidency."
SJMN91-06140099,34,19,The free exhibition has turned a gray room in the town's public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum.
SJMN91-06140099,35,16,The display patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly ordinary.
SJMN91-06140099,36,26,"There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats, or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at Christmas."
SJMN91-06140099,37,47,"There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, Dan Quayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with Sharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the Fort Wayne Country Club."
SJMN91-06140099,38,13,"It is all very 50s, very Middle American, almost surreal in its innocence."
SJMN91-06140099,39,11,"There are windows into the workings of the Quayle family, too."
SJMN91-06140099,40,25,"For example, his father, James, signed the report cards when Dan brought home poor grades, and his mother signed when he brought home good ones."
SJMN91-06140099,41,28,"And there are letters and poems that he wrote, which only go to show that one does not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics."
SJMN91-06140099,42,31,"Dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on Nov. 22, 1960, when he was 13 years old:; My Dad is very very nice; But he is not made of sugar and spice."
SJMN91-06140099,43,20,Sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed; But at other times he is as cheerful as a bird.
SJMN91-06140099,44,46,"The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper announcement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden ""Quayle & Quayle"" shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assorted campaign souvenirs, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988 Republican National Convention."
SJMN91-06140099,45,11,"Ultimately, the foundation wants to build a repository for the memorabilia."
SJMN91-06140099,46,35,"It has already organized a walking tour of historic Quayle sites, like the white, ranch-style house where he spent his early days, and Nick's Kitchen, where he likes to order tenderloins, fries and a milkshake."
SJMN91-06140099,47,24,"""We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care what the newspapers say,"" said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers."

FT922-1115,6,50,"MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday."
FT922-1115,7,26,"Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions."
FT922-1115,8,15,"Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the statement says."
FT922-1115,9,31,"Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months."
FT922-1115,10,40,"He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations, including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'."
FT922-1115,11,34,"Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies."
FT922-1115,12,32,"Sir Robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, making a total of more than Pounds 180m."
FT922-1115,13,12,'Some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions'.
FT922-1115,14,10,Nine of the payments were authorised solely by Robert Maxwell.
FT922-1115,15,18,"The others were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, he says."
FT922-1115,16,28,"One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington, former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell."
FT922-1115,17,12,"Two authorisations were countersigned by Mr Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director."
FT922-1115,18,24,Sir Robert says the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest knew there was anything improper about these payments.
FT922-1115,19,25,"With these exceptions, 'the independent directors . . . were not involved in, and did not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he says."
FT922-1115,20,37,Sir Robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department - which was headed by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits.
FT922-1115,21,25,"'The treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he says."
FT922-1115,22,97,"In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities."
FT922-1115,23,79,"The report details a Pounds 50m loan made by Bankers Trust in London last October which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private interests, Separately, the statement highlights three transfers of more than Pounds 40m from MGN to Goldman Sachs - Pounds 11m of this was transferred on Robert Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in Maxwell Communication Corporation stock."
FT922-1115,24,19,"The balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it says."
FT922-1115,25,30,He says MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected for improper purposes'.
FT922-1115,26,20,"If so, he says 'it will be possible to seek orders against them . . . for the sums paid'."
FT922-1115,27,31,"He says MGN is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases, and hopes to recover money through claims on insurance policies written on Robert Maxwell's life ."

FT922-2972,6,26,ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed.
FT922-2972,7,18,"Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered."
FT922-2972,8,34,"Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England."
FT922-2972,9,33,"Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time."
FT922-2972,10,27,"Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies."
FT922-2972,11,20,"In these 'spot' transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre."
FT922-2972,12,22,"On a number of occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan."
FT922-2972,13,26,"Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals."
FT922-2972,14,17,At least Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way.
FT922-2972,15,15,A former Maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell businesses.
FT922-2972,16,27,One banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called 'teaming and lading'.
FT922-2972,17,35,"It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July."
FT922-2972,18,25,"At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m."
FT922-2972,19,39,"NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds - less than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made."
FT922-2972,20,16,"NatWest was forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which was eventually repaid."
FT922-2972,21,36,"The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England."
FT922-2972,22,18,"Instead, it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to the Maxwell businesses."
FT922-2972,23,17,"NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago."
FT922-2972,24,39,"Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price."

FT922-3446,6,41,"DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times."
FT922-3446,7,47,"Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell."
FT922-3446,8,24,"This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family."
FT922-3446,9,40,"The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust."
FT922-3446,10,27,The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
FT922-3446,11,30,The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts.
FT922-3446,12,26,"If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC."
FT922-3446,13,35,"The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares."
FT922-3446,14,12,"Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals."
FT922-3446,15,8,Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.
FT922-3446,16,25,Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.
FT922-3446,17,14,He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa.
FT922-3446,18,11,He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'.
FT922-3446,19,16,He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time'.
FT922-3446,20,31,"He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said."
FT922-3446,21,24,"Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell."
FT922-3446,22,32,"The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex."
FT922-3446,23,48,"On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company."
FT922-3446,24,31,"The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'."
FT922-3446,25,35,"Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares."
FT922-3446,26,29,"The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme)."
FT922-3446,27,18,"Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total."
FT922-3446,28,22,"At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds."
FT922-3446,29,41,"As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds."
FT922-3446,30,35,"In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT."
FT922-3446,31,19,"In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays."
FT922-3446,32,22,"Goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account."

FT924-12616,6,30,THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself as a 'strong ' chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters.
FT924-12616,7,47,"'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge."
FT924-12616,8,19,There may be doubts about Robert Maxwell's strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game.
FT924-12616,9,18,"In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New York."
FT924-12616,10,17,And when Pergamon was sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses.
FT924-12616,11,32,"Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire."
FT924-12616,12,18,"'Price Waterhouse took months and months to come up with any information about the company,' said Mr Pein."
FT924-12616,13,35,"Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses."
FT924-12616,14,35,"Mr Pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge - prefabricated buildings in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire - until they found permanent premises."
FT924-12616,15,11,"However, he said that Arthur Andersen wanted two years back rent."
FT924-12616,16,19,"Despite the year of difficulties, Chess and Bridge is now set up in new premises in Euston Road, London."
FT924-12616,17,19,The company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge books and products in the UK .

FT941-11518,6,31,"Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell."
FT941-11518,7,36,"Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production."
FT941-11518,8,17,The musical tells the tycoon's life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan.
FT941-11518,9,16,"Now in rehearsal, the show is due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11."
FT941-11518,10,19,The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before its first night is regarded as without precedent.
FT941-11518,11,49,"However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as 'the musical review that will make you laugh, sing - and be angry'."
FT941-11518,12,26,"The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies."
FT941-11518,13,22,Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested.
FT941-11518,14,13,"However, he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers."
FT941-11518,15,57,"Press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers . Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing company."
FT941-11518,16,25,"Turning down his request, the judge asked him: 'Is it going to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation'?"
FT941-11518,17,11,"At that point, lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing ."

FT942-12054,6,37,"Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid."
FT942-12054,7,29,The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme.
FT942-12054,8,32,"The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading."
FT942-12054,9,36,"The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid."
FT942-12054,10,13,The writs allege Goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by Robert Maxwell.
FT942-12054,11,53,The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'.
FT942-12054,12,17,"The writs claim that Goldman was 'competing directly with its customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'."
FT942-12054,13,22,"On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss trusts."
FT942-12054,14,36,"On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family."
FT942-12054,15,43,"The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT."
FT942-12054,16,46,The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.
FT942-12054,17,42,"Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000' ."

SJMN91-06346032,8,20,Investigators have said Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in a desperate attempt to deal with his empire's crushing debts.
SJMN91-06346032,9,13,They also have said some questionable transactions may have occurred after Maxwell's death.
SJMN91-06346032,10,29,"In an interview published today by the Daily Mirror, Robert Maxwell's London flagship newspaper, Kevin Maxwell was quoted as saying of the pensioners:; ""I am desperately sorry for them."

AP890922-0224,9,26,Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was ``a firm favorite'' to win.
AP890922-0224,10,32,"Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe."

AP891026-0208,14,34,"``Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him,'' Ishiguro said."

AP901008-0174,12,42,"``British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000 over the next 23 weeks,'' said Christine Shaw of Book Trust."
AP901008-0174,13,13,The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the prize.

AP901008-0174,15,29,The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.

AP901016-0112,14,28,"``The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult''."
AP901016-0112,15,26,"Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964."
AP901016-0112,16,35,"In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across England and to France."
AP901016-0112,17,14,The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book.

FT923-3822,7,25,"THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist."
FT923-3822,8,39,"The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention."
FT923-3822,9,33,Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
FT923-3822,10,6,This year's shortlist contains no surprises.
FT923-3822,11,32,London's litterati have for weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week.
FT923-3822,12,11,Last night the bookmakers William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite.
FT923-3822,13,11,The shortlist is: Serenity House by Christopher Hope (MacMillan Pounds 14.99).
FT923-3822,14,11,Black comedy by a master South Africa-born specialist in the trade.
FT923-3822,15,26,"Set in a Highgate 'eventide refuge' where euthanasia is an unspoken word and its senior citizen, Max Montfalcon, turns out to be a geriatric Nazi scientist."
FT923-3822,16,12,The FT review next Saturday will describe it as 'surreal farce ..
FT923-3822,17,3,scabrously enjoyable '..
FT923-3822,18,9,The Butcher's Boy by Patrick McCabe (Picador Pounds 14.99).
FT923-3822,19,15,"An Irish murderer, a soft-in-the-head orphan jailed for life, recalls his life in grisly detail."
FT923-3822,20,20,The FT reviewer said that 'the misery and deprivation of working class life have never been so brutally evoked '..
FT923-3822,21,21,Black Dogs by Ian McEwan (Secker & Warburg Pounds 14.99). McEwan's fiction is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive.
FT923-3822,22,6,He is the novelist of misanthropy.
FT923-3822,23,21,"This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal."
FT923-3822,24,9,The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99).
FT923-3822,25,38,"The Sri Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives in Canada, has followed 'in the skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four characters in a Tuscan villa in the closing months of the last war."
FT923-3822,26,11,"The central metaphor is bombs - disposal of, and then Hiroshima."
FT923-3822,27,24,The 'English patient' is a central mystery around which the others' stories orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames; who is he?
FT923-3822,28,11,The FT review on Saturday will hail it as a masterpiece.
FT923-3822,29,10,Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts (Virago Pounds 14.99).
FT923-3822,30,9,The surprise contender because it is not yet published.
FT923-3822,31,18,Roberts comes from an Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a strong rural-Normandy atmosphere.
FT923-3822,32,6,"Two cousins, one pious, one worldly."
FT923-3822,33,6,Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux.
FT923-3822,34,12,Lots of action in the kitchen; something is hidden in the cellar.
FT923-3822,35,9,Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth (Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99).
FT923-3822,36,17,Unsworth's massive novel about the 1750s slave trade came out early this year to widespread critical praise.
FT923-3822,37,12,The shipboard detail - the horrors of the trade -are brilliantly done.
FT923-3822,38,22,The judges will have to rule on the characterisation of the European protagonists who go off to found a Utopia in Florida.
FT923-3822,39,28,"The judges this year, who will include Independent journalist Mark Lawson and John Coldstream, literary editor of The Daily Telegraph, will be chaired by the biographer Victoria Glendinning."

FT923-3822,43,3,London Page 15
FT943-3897,6,41,"It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it."
FT943-3897,7,26,"Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade."
FT943-3897,8,24,"This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg."
FT943-3897,9,52,"They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide."
FT943-3897,10,22,The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature.
FT943-3897,11,24,"Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels."
FT943-3897,12,12,But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction.
FT943-3897,13,18,It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.
FT943-3897,14,3,"First, the similarities."
FT943-3897,15,7,A good yarn is a good yarn.
FT943-3897,16,37,"Of the 1894 books, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts."
FT943-3897,17,18,The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.
FT943-3897,18,29,"On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend."
FT943-3897,19,9,All the books on both lists are gripping stories.
FT943-3897,20,5,The lists share key themes.
FT943-3897,21,29,"Both, for instance, have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set in the First World War in German East Africa."
FT943-3897,22,5,Both provoke in similar ways.
FT943-3897,23,36,"The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver."
FT943-3897,24,26,"It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it."
FT943-3897,25,12,"A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed."
FT943-3897,26,29,"Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics."
FT943-3897,27,30,"But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century."
FT943-3897,28,21,For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.
FT943-3897,29,22,"Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland."
FT943-3897,30,23,This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience.
FT943-3897,31,18,"The trick works - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies."
FT943-3897,32,8,"Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600."
FT943-3897,33,9,"The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction."
FT943-3897,34,19,"Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made between high and low art."
FT943-3897,35,19,"In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today."
FT943-3897,36,29,"Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies."
FT943-3897,37,24,"All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later."
FT943-3897,38,12,Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894?
FT943-3897,39,8,"Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part."
FT943-3897,40,39,"Socially, the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite."
FT943-3897,41,11,"The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant."
FT943-3897,42,22,"Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum."
FT943-3897,43,18,Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age.
FT943-3897,44,26,Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow.
FT943-3897,45,23,The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents.
FT943-3897,46,20,"George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel."
FT943-3897,47,12,Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.
FT943-3897,48,33,"The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps."
FT943-3897,49,42,"Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved."
FT943-3897,50,16,"Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894."
FT943-3897,51,32,"Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed."
FT943-3897,52,18,The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them.
FT943-3897,53,32,Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.
FT943-3897,54,16,It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today.
FT943-3897,55,29,"Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time)."
FT943-3897,56,26,"Which book will win on October 15? Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide."
FT943-3897,57,50,"Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery."
FT943-3897,58,5,My vote goes to Trilby.
FT943-3897,59,37,"Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory."
FT943-3897,60,32,"Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller ."

FT943-5106,8,64,"The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed."
FT943-5106,9,50,"As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'."
FT943-5106,10,43,"The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award."
FT943-5106,11,25,"Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace."
FT943-5106,12,26,"But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever."
FT943-5106,13,50,"One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge."
FT943-5106,14,31,"Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud."
FT943-5106,15,18,"But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics."
FT943-5106,16,17,"'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker'."
FT943-5106,17,14,"The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11 ."

FT944-16774,6,42,"After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg."
FT944-16774,7,41,"The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable."
FT944-16774,8,19,"Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible."
FT944-16774,9,18,"'We had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hours of debate."
FT944-16774,10,19,"Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was made extremely cross by the decision."
FT944-16774,11,10,"'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing against bureaucracy,' she said."
FT944-16774,12,6,'My eyes are stretched in disbelief.
FT944-16774,13,6,The voting system is completely mad.
FT944-16774,14,10,Kelman was the least favourite of the three front runners.
FT944-16774,15,12,If it had been a short story it would have been fine'.
FT944-16774,16,17,"Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize."
FT944-16774,17,28,"In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My culture and my language have the right to exist'."
FT944-16774,18,35,"One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is'."
FT944-16774,19,11,"The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy."
FT944-16774,20,11,But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.
FT944-16774,21,12,Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.
FT944-16774,22,34,"Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood."
FT944-16774,23,16,"Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic."
FT944-16774,24,35,"The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh."
FT944-16774,25,19,"In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist."
FT944-16774,26,13,"Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies."
FT944-16774,27,12,"'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said."
FT944-16774,28,16,Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A Disaffection .

WSJ871110-0154,9,19,"You may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie."
WSJ871110-0154,10,17,All of those people published new works of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 months.
WSJ871110-0154,11,39,"And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the British Isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land."
WSJ871110-0154,12,19,In recent weeks the Booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift.
WSJ871110-0154,13,15,"And nearly every article, from book reviews to author interviews, has featured the latest odds."
WSJ871110-0154,14,24,"The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency."

WSJ871110-0154,21,30,"America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize."
WSJ871110-0154,22,16,"With the possible exception of France's respected Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else."
WSJ871110-0154,23,20,"Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarities exist."

WSJ871110-0154,25,16,"This year each British publisher could submit three new titles, for a grand total of 93."
WSJ871110-0154,26,38,"As one judge noted wearily, ""By August, I was in more than a slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing at the bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking on the telephone""."
WSJ871110-0154,27,17,"Next comes the ""short-list,"" the judges' top six, which was announced with great fanfare in late September."

WSJ871110-0154,31,33,"The awards presentation came on the last Thursday in October, and like any major awards presentation, it came complete with limousines, banquet (salmon mousse, champagne sorbet and English roast beef) and television cameras."
WSJ871110-0154,32,15,The suspense was genuine; the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement.
WSJ871110-0154,33,18,"To be sure, the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of ""Eastenders,"" Britain's popular soap opera."
WSJ871110-0154,34,22,"Yet interest was sufficient for Andre Deutsch, ""Moon Tiger's"" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copies almost the minute Mrs."
WSJ871110-0154,35,9,Lively -- and the nation -- heard the news.
WSJ871110-0154,36,26,"By British standards, sales figures for recent Booker winners are stunning, from ""The Old Devils"" (80,000 hard-cover copies) to Anita Brookner's ""Hotel du Lac"" (40,000 copies)."

WSJ871110-0154,38,18,"Short-listed authors are just a few paces behind, sharing the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow."

WSJ871110-0154,42,18,"Indeed, there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography."
WSJ871110-0154,43,23,"Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone."
WSJ871110-0154,44,28,"This year the Sunday Times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot."
WSJ871110-0154,45,7,"It wasn't always this way, of course."

WSJ871110-0154,49,20,"The early fuss was kept within the literary world, with critics sniping over choices and the prize's varied ground rules."
WSJ871110-0154,50,40,"The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's ""Ending Up,"" one of the short-listed books, was his best ever."
WSJ871110-0154,51,12,"As it happens, she was married to Mr. Amis at the time."
WSJ871110-0154,52,3,He didn't win.
WSJ871110-0154,53,26,"But many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's ""Schindler's Ark,"" or ""Schindler's List"" as it is known in the U.S."

AP880521-0088,10,40,"The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert."
AP880521-0088,11,27,The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
AP880521-0088,12,27,"Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire."
AP880521-0088,13,5,Greece won independence in 1830.
AP880521-0088,14,17,"The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture, ``The Massacre of Chios,'' based on the raids."
AP880521-0088,15,31,"``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence,'' Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press."
AP880521-0088,16,28,"Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles."
AP880521-0088,17,9,"He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said."
AP880521-0088,18,35,"``When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church,'' he said."
AP880521-0088,19,9,``The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios.
AP880521-0088,20,13,"I think there may be gold and silver items as well,'' he said."
AP880521-0088,21,11,"``I also saw what I recognized as human bones,'' he added."
AP880521-0088,22,14,He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet in length.
AP880521-0088,23,30,"According to historians, more than 1,000 people _ including 400 Greek captives _ were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822."
AP880521-0088,24,16,"The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing a boat stuffed with explosives."
AP880521-0088,25,19,Its pointed bow was rammed into the mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit.
AP880521-0088,26,15,"The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast that split the ship."

AP880521-0088,28,25,"``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from this particular period of history,'' said George Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine archaeology."
AP880521-0088,29,35,"Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is a ship that must be explored''."
AP880521-0088,30,22,Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project.
AP880521-0088,31,29,"American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers, have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast."
AP880521-0088,32,20,Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out excavations .

AP880913-0070,10,28,"It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified."
AP880913-0070,11,6,"There were no casualties, he said."
AP880913-0070,12,30,"The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer."
AP880913-0070,13,9,He did not give the ship's origin or destination.
AP880913-0070,14,14,The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds.
AP880913-0070,15,26,"They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said."
AP880913-0070,16,13,A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene.
AP880913-0070,17,30,"Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland."
AP880913-0070,18,26,Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany .
AP890125-0099,7,31,"Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago."
AP890125-0099,8,32,"Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona'' scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee."
AP890125-0099,9,40,"Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19. Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean."
AP890125-0099,10,3,Six sailors died.
AP890125-0099,11,19,The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
AP890125-0099,12,25,"The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money."
AP890125-0099,13,26,"Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America."
AP890125-0099,14,22,"In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz criticized him."
AP890125-0099,15,25,"Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria."
AP890125-0099,16,15,"``My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated,'' Gratz told the house."
AP890125-0099,17,52,"``If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way as is his duty''."
AP890125-0099,18,29,"In past newspaper stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant."
AP890125-0099,19,15,"Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping Proksch in several other ways."

AP890201-0043,11,24,"National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill."

AP890201-0043,15,19,"The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique."
AP890201-0043,16,18,Telam did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down.
AP890201-0043,17,14,The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known.
AP890201-0043,18,38,"The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington."
AP890201-0043,19,22,"The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip."
AP890201-0043,20,24,"It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer station."
AP890201-0043,21,35,"The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation statement said."
AP890201-0043,22,17,There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
AP890201-0043,23,22,"Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped."
AP890201-0043,24,20,"``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement said."
AP890201-0043,25,13,It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday.
AP890201-0043,26,9,"Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill."
AP890201-0043,27,28,"Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible''."
AP890201-0043,28,27,"The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station."
AP890201-0043,29,28,"The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday."
AP890201-0043,30,9,"But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said Renerie."
AP890201-0043,31,25,"Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said ."
AP890417-0189,11,25,Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
AP890417-0189,12,5,Twenty-three crew members were rescued.
AP890417-0189,13,31,"The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York."
AP890417-0189,14,12,"``They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,'' Midgett said."
AP890417-0189,15,35,"The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said."
AP890417-0189,16,15,"The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty."
AP890417-0189,17,11,"The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said."
AP890417-0189,18,36,"The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said."
AP890417-0189,19,32,"The first mayday call went out at 9:05 a.m. A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship."
AP890417-0189,20,6,The lifeboat was spotted around noon.
AP890417-0189,21,28,"The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said."
AP890417-0189,22,10,"About four hours later, they were rescued by the Ravenscraig."
AP890417-0189,23,17,"The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be sinking or sunk, Midgett said."
AP890417-0189,24,12,Visibility in the rough seas was five to eight miles Monday afternoon.
AP890417-0189,25,13,"The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England."
AP890417-0189,26,24,"It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry."
AP890417-0189,27,19,"The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known ."
AP890613-0125,7,34,"A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the ``Voyage of the Damned'' was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday."
AP890613-0125,8,13,"``They're going to have to move it,'' said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady."
AP890613-0125,9,22,The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast.
AP890613-0125,10,10,"It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S."
AP890613-0125,11,21,Coast Guard turned away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust.
AP890613-0125,12,30,"The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe."
AP890613-0125,13,10,Most of the passengers later died in Nazi concentration camps.
AP890613-0125,14,29,"For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a living reef."
AP890613-0125,15,12,"``It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly _ boom!"
AP890613-0125,16,18,"_ somebody made a mistake,'' said Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event."
AP890613-0125,17,17,Federal and Dade County officials who allowed Resnick to sink the boat are upset about the result.
AP890613-0125,18,14,"``They didn't even come close,'' complained Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department."
AP890613-0125,19,21,"Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges."
AP890613-0125,20,28,"It's also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy, he said."
AP890613-0125,21,17,"``It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could hit it,'' Crespo said."
AP890613-0125,22,18,The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by June 22.
AP890613-0125,23,11,"If it's not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick."
AP890613-0125,24,21,"Resnick blames the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it was sunk."
AP890613-0125,25,21,"Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site."
AP890613-0125,26,13,"Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the coast."
AP890613-0125,27,7,Resnick said someone will have to pay.
AP890613-0125,28,19,"``I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys,'' said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director."
AP890613-0125,29,12,"The Ostwind was built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely used it."
AP890613-0125,30,19,"After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a Jacksonville marina owner ."
AP890622-0157,10,39,"A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday."
AP890622-0157,11,22,"During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and proud'' two weeks ago."
AP890622-0157,12,25,"Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German."
AP890622-0157,13,16,"``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said, translating himself back into English."
AP890622-0157,14,5,``We found no human remains.
AP890622-0157,15,6,We touched nothing and took nothing.
AP890622-0157,16,14,... The future of the Bismarck is in the hands of the German people''.
AP890622-0157,17,31,"He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941."
AP890622-0157,18,38,"Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire."
AP890622-0157,19,15,"``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' Ballard said."
AP890622-0157,20,11,``It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length.
AP890622-0157,21,7,"It was clearly flooded, stem to stern''."
AP890622-0157,22,13,"``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he added."
AP890622-0157,23,32,"It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships."
AP890622-0157,24,18,Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
AP890622-0157,25,41,"In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable."
AP890622-0157,26,15,"Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered British biplanes, it was unable to escape."
AP890622-0157,27,38,"Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up."
AP890622-0157,28,19,"Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands."
AP890622-0157,29,20,"The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France."
AP890622-0157,30,11,"He said it was in remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved''."
AP890622-0157,31,28,"Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck''!"
AP890622-0157,32,9,"Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived."
AP890622-0157,33,27,British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a German U-boat.
AP890622-0157,34,8,German vessels later rescued only five more survivors.
AP890622-0157,35,11,"The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie."
AP890622-0157,36,16,"The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation."
AP890622-0157,37,33,"If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power."
AP890622-0157,38,40,"The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419."
AP890622-0157,39,30,"The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance."
AP890622-0157,40,16,"Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people."
AP890622-0157,41,38,"The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg ."
AP890820-0068,8,31,"A Florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S."
AP890820-0068,9,4,Coast Guard reported Sunday.
AP890820-0068,10,34,"William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were ``weak but recovering'' at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said U.S."
AP890820-0068,11,7,Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
AP890820-0068,12,24,"The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday."
AP890820-0068,13,2,The U.S.
AP890820-0068,14,14,"Coast Guard's Pacific Command is headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco."
AP890820-0068,15,28,"William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ``several'' whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica."
AP890820-0068,16,9,"``They were large, according to Mr. Butler,'' Vallecillo said."
AP890820-0068,17,7,``But he didn't know how many whales''.
AP890820-0068,18,21,"The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said."
AP890820-0068,19,26,"Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any recorded cases of whale aggression."
AP890820-0068,20,12,"``This happened in the early morning hours'' with good visibility, he said."
AP890820-0068,21,7,``This is the first (case) I've documented''.
AP890820-0068,22,33,"As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat, where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said."
AP890820-0068,23,34,"As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit."
AP890820-0068,24,3,Butler told U.S.
AP890820-0068,25,18,Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
AP890820-0068,26,25,"On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ``fisheries'' patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple."
AP890820-0068,27,18,"They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said."
AP890820-0068,28,7,"Butler is an experienced sailor, he said."
AP890820-0068,29,25,"Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents, Vallecillo said ."
FBIS4-57796,14,48,"BFN [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Today, the Foreign Ministry said that control operations carried out by the corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out ""in accordance with international law and in coordination with the Foreign Ministry""."
FBIS4-57796,15,27,The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May.
FBIS4-57796,16,28,"The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro stayed near the Korean ship ""given the adverse weather conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search and rescue""."
FBIS4-57796,17,26,"The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to answer to the Argentine ship's warnings."
FBIS4-57796,18,23,"The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking ship."
FBIS4-57796,19,30,"The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the coast of Malvinas and ""in accordance with bilateral agreements with Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility to British authorities""."

FT943-178,5,7,Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat.
FT943-178,6,30,"But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high."
FT943-178,7,21,"As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up."
FT943-178,8,46,"The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing."
FT943-178,9,25,"The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety."
FT943-178,10,15,But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety.
FT943-178,11,29,Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987.
FT943-178,12,21,"Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration."
FT943-178,13,11,Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.
FT943-178,14,9,First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered.
FT943-178,15,23,"Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line."
FT943-178,16,23,Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks.
FT943-178,17,21,These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise.
FT943-178,18,34,"It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs."
FT943-178,19,26,"Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel."
FT943-178,20,21,But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster.
FT943-178,21,17,"Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations."
FT943-178,22,24,"The IMO has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners."
FT943-178,23,19,"Third, the IMO should be given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training."
FT943-178,24,16,Much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.
FT943-178,25,16,"Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily."
FT943-178,26,18,"As things stand, it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force."
FT943-178,27,21,"The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding up the process."
FT943-178,28,13,"Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector."
FT943-178,29,11,"Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register."
FT943-178,30,20,But this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down.
FT943-178,31,19,"When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid."
FT943-178,32,39,"If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia ."

AP890105-0224,7,19,"Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said."
AP890105-0224,8,18,"``Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition,'' hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night."
AP890105-0224,9,9,``The senator is expected to make a full recovery''.
AP890105-0224,10,32,"Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said."
AP890105-0224,11,23,"A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr."
AP890105-0224,12,4,"R.D. Dignan, of Dallas."
AP890105-0224,13,8,"Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said."
AP890105-0224,14,14,"When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed."
AP890105-0224,15,16,"Tests of that growth showed it to contain some ``malignant but well differentiated cells,'' Habgood said."
AP890105-0224,16,24,"Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said."
AP890105-0224,17,14,"After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant."
AP890105-0224,18,19,He also served as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel.
AP890105-0224,19,11,President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on Dec. 16.
AP890105-0224,20,8,The nomination is subject to Senate approval .
AP890211-0110,9,29,"Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday."
AP890211-0110,10,17,"Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee."
AP890211-0110,11,21,"One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe."
AP890211-0110,12,44,"The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors."
AP890211-0110,13,31,"Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties."
AP890211-0110,14,22,"A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports, saying ``it's (the nomination) before the committee''."
AP890211-0110,15,15,"Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did not answer a reporter's calls Saturday."
AP890211-0110,16,36,"In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said he could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense activities'' in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc."
AP890211-0110,17,34,"That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in June of 1987."
AP890211-0110,18,47,"In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported."
AP890211-0110,19,26,Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations.
AP890211-0110,20,15,"He said he earned $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December."
AP890211-0110,21,36,"The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons involved."
AP890211-0110,22,26,"The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said."
AP890211-0110,23,20,It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly.
AP890211-0110,24,29,"The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower."
AP890211-0110,25,42,"The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair."

AP890228-0146,11,42,"An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, ``like a ton of bricks'' and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination."

AP890228-0146,18,29,"The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s."
AP890228-0146,19,30,A congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week.
AP890228-0146,20,28,"Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol."

AP890309-0143,17,25,Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition.
AP890309-0143,18,21,She said her ``most serious concerns'' were over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator.

AP890309-0143,43,11,``The time will come as soon as the vote is completed.

AP890309-0143,46,14,It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared for Tower or leaning his way.
AP890309-0143,47,18,"Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote."
AP890309-0143,48,17,"Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together."

AP890309-0143,53,28,The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided Democratic senators announced they would vote ``no''.

AP890309-0143,60,8,", all said they would vote against Tower."
AP890309-0143,61,40,"Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he drinks heavily, leading to ``a recklessness in the social sense'' entirely different from his behavior when sober ."
AP890316-0012,10,2,John G.
AP890316-0012,11,8,"Tower has fallen, but the sky has not."
AP890316-0012,12,21,"For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual."
AP890316-0012,13,14,President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation.
AP890316-0012,14,24,That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House.
AP890316-0012,15,17,Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats.
AP890316-0012,16,13,They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower.
AP890316-0012,17,19,"Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed."
AP890316-0012,18,11,"There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized."
AP890316-0012,19,30,The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
AP890316-0012,20,15,"``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va."
AP890316-0012,21,17,That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright.
AP890316-0012,22,23,"But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode."
AP890316-0012,23,17,"While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he burned no bridges to congressional Democrats."
AP890316-0012,24,29,"He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed."
AP890316-0012,25,16,"But he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in escalating the fight."
AP890316-0012,26,10,"``That's over,'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat."
AP890316-0012,27,2,``That's history.
AP890316-0012,28,8,And now we are going to go forward''.
AP890316-0012,29,27,The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president something he wants.
AP890316-0012,30,19,"But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters."
AP890316-0012,31,24,"Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon."
AP890316-0012,32,25,It was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
AP890316-0012,33,16,Tower had not been a Reagan man _ he had supported Bush for the 1980 nomination.
AP890316-0012,34,35,"And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post."
AP890316-0012,35,29,"After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee."
AP890316-0012,36,23,"Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job."
AP890316-0012,37,11,"Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television."
AP890316-0012,38,14,"And when that didn't work, he offered to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member."
AP890316-0012,39,30,"Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency."
AP890316-0012,40,2,No deal.
AP890316-0012,41,18,"So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who was a former senator."
AP890316-0012,42,28,"Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes."
AP890316-0012,43,5,Tower did not restrain himself.
AP890316-0012,44,18,"Battling for the job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be ``damning the president's judgment''."
AP890316-0012,45,15,He said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat.
AP890316-0012,46,38,"Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the Tower decision."
AP890316-0012,47,16,"But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues."
AP890316-0012,48,18,"Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed."
AP890316-0012,49,14,He told his Georgia constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership.
AP890316-0012,50,16,"``In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived,'' Nunn said, ``and that's particularly true of the president.''"

LA020189-0050,9,38,"In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the ""moral character"" to be secretary of defense ."
LA020189-0050,10,41,"""Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married,"" conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee."

LA020189-0050,12,21,Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator.
LA020189-0050,13,28,"But several members conceded that, while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the Pentagon's top job, he probably will win Senate approval anyway ."
LA020189-0050,14,27,"""We've had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee, and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge,"" said committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) ."
LA020189-0050,15,27,"Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation, testified that Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and management reform."
LA020189-0050,16,36,"In an extraordinary challenge to Tower's nomination, Weyrich also suggested that Tower's moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments ""to bring pressure on the United States government and on him personally ."
LA020189-0050,17,26,"""It is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life,"" Weyrich said."
LA020189-0050,18,6,"""Private morals have public effects"" ."
LA020189-0050,19,26,"Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 1984."
LA020189-0050,20,33,He has been dogged by reports that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the Pentagon faces .
LA020189-0050,21,26,"In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush called the talk ""a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless""."

LA020189-0050,25,27,"Fulbright Institute scholar William C. Jackson Jr. and William G. Phillips, president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense, joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination."
LA020189-0050,26,41,"Phillips echoed Jackson's complaint that Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise ""serious doubts that John Tower is the best man for the job . . . at this time in our history"" ."
LA020189-0050,27,8,A leading committee Democrat acknowledged this point .
LA020189-0050,28,38,"""I . . . wondered why the President of the United States chose John Tower for this job, given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing,"" said Nebraska Sen. James J. Exon."

LA020189-0050,30,41,"Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), in clarifying the grounds on which Senate committees may assess presidential nominees, told witnesses that ""it is not a function of the Senate to say that this individual, this nominee, is the best man qualified"" ."
LA020189-0050,31,33,"Weyrich also told the committee that President Bush's transition team ""received hundreds of letters"" opposing Tower's nomination, some of which ""contain specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of Mr. Tower"" ."
LA020189-0050,32,26,"In a closed session of the committee, Weyrich was unable to add to his own observations with more than hearsay, according to Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.)."
LA020189-0050,33,18,Weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or content of the letters .
LA020189-0050,34,45,"But the allegation, reviewed in advance by the committee, prompted Nunn and Warner, the panel's ranking minority member, to write White House counsel C.

LA020489-0035,9,45,"In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness, sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem ."
LA020489-0035,10,17,Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him .
LA020489-0035,11,42,"But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the former Texas senator's drinking problem ""may be ongoing"" and that his confirmation remains in doubt ."
LA020489-0035,12,32,"The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific, giving the date and place of the alleged incident, and was made by an informant who identified herself, a knowledgeable source said."
LA020489-0035,13,23,"The episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides ."
LA020489-0035,14,42,"Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified Dallas woman ."
LA020489-0035,15,20,"If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, an authoritative committee source said ."
LA020489-0035,16,21,"FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday, interviewing the owner, the maitre d', bartenders and waiters, The Times learned."

LA020489-0035,18,4,Wine or Tonic Water
LA020489-0035,19,32,But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine.
LA020489-0035,20,16,"In fact, in recent weeks, the staff told agents, he often has ordered tonic water ."

LA020489-0035,38,4,Tower Urged to Withdraw
LA020489-0035,39,22,And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post .
LA020489-0035,40,30,"In an editorial prepared for Monday's issue, Defense News, a trade paper widely read by defense contractors and on Capitol Hill, says: ""Withdrawal is necessary because the record of Mr."
LA020489-0035,41,18,"Tower's professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness . . . "" ."
LA020489-0035,42,34,"Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986 ."
LA020489-0035,43,21,"It said that ""the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door (between government and industry) is appalling""."
LA020489-0035,44,26,"Tower has said that he was paid a total of more than $750,000 by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service ."
LA020489-0035,45,26,Tower's profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of members of the Armed Services Committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination .
LA020489-0035,46,3,Called Morally Unfit
LA020489-0035,47,37,"Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday, when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing ."
LA020489-0035,48,28,"After a lengthy closed session in which Tower was allowed to respond to Weyrich's charges, Nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem with alcohol ."

LA021189-0003,10,35,"The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday ."
LA021189-0003,11,24,"Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc. only on civil aviation matters, not as a consultant on military systems ."
LA021189-0003,12,27,"But, in a divorce deposition, taken in June, 1987, Tower stated that he had given the company advice on ""selling certain systems to the Defense Department"" ."
LA021189-0003,13,21,"In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8,000 a month."
LA021189-0003,14,12,"Records show that the payments continued from June, 1986, until December, 1988."
LA021189-0003,15,19,"Also, he served on the board of directors of the company, the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC ."
LA021189-0003,16,3,Concerns About Veracity
LA021189-0003,17,29,"The discrepancy, sources said, has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation ."
LA021189-0003,18,26,"And it raises the question of whether Tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, they said ."
LA021189-0003,19,16,Tower's relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by some senators about his nomination.
LA021189-0003,20,52,"Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace paid him ."
LA021189-0003,21,23,"In his testimony, Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a half-dozen U.S. defense firms that do business with the Pentagon."
LA021189-0003,22,27,The addition of the British firm to the list would add another -- and the first foreign-based firm -- whose interests could pose a potential conflict .
LA021189-0003,23,26,Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm .
LA021189-0003,24,11,Tower aides said they had no comment on the matter .
LA021189-0003,25,22,A lengthy FBI investigation into Tower's business dealings and his personal behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation.
LA021189-0003,26,31,"The FBI is looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another 10 days ."
LA021189-0003,27,38,"The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday ."
LA021189-0003,28,20,The allegation was raised by a witness in the FBI's massive Ill Wind probe into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying .
LA021189-0003,29,42,"Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation ."
LA021189-0003,30,28,A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees .
LA021189-0003,31,7,Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga).
LA021189-0003,32,30,and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against Tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved .
LA021189-0003,33,27,"The sworn deposition about Tower's business dealings was never filed in court because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings."
LA021189-0003,34,27,But the document was obtained by the FBI as part of its background investigation of the nominee and is included in the committee's file on Tower .
LA021189-0003,35,2,Tower's Testimony
LA021189-0003,36,35,Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the company's commercial jets to U.S. airlines.
LA021189-0003,37,19,He said also that he advised the firm on U.S. trade legislation and gave opinions on currency fluctuations .
LA021189-0003,38,36,"Tower told the committee that he could ""recall no actions in connection with any defense activities"" and did not include his income from British Aerospace among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors ."
LA021189-0003,39,36,"In the divorce papers, however, Tower said that he went to work for British Aerospace Inc. on June 1, 1986, eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator in the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reductions talks in Geneva."
LA021189-0003,40,27,"Around the same time, he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms, including Rockwell International Inc., Textron Inc., LTV Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp ."
LA021189-0003,41,21,"In the deposition, Tower said that Rockwell paid him $120,000 a year but said he was ""underutilized"" by the firm ."
LA021189-0003,42,23,"He said he advised British Aerospace on its chances of selling its training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon ."
LA021189-0003,43,3,Deposition Cites Weapons
LA021189-0003,44,38,"Among the British Aerospace products Tower tried to sell to U.S. military officials were the Tornado fighter, the Hawk trainer, the Rapier anti-aircraft missile and the Seawolf short-range air defense missile for ships, according to the deposition ."
LA021189-0003,45,28,"He said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was ""plugged in in this town"" and ""knows the defense business pretty well""."
LA021189-0003,46,11,"He said that his contacts throughout government made him ""marketable"" ."
LA021189-0003,47,24,The complex Foreign Agents Registration Act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the United States to register with the Justice Department.
LA021189-0003,48,9,"No registration by Tower is on file, officials said."
LA021189-0003,49,3,In related developments:

LA021189-0003,51,19,"I have never seen drinking be a factor in John Tower's life, other than a social glass of wine."
LA021189-0003,52,40,". . . Those of us who know him, worked with him, can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem, it did not affect him when he was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee"" ."
LA021189-0003,53,24,"When asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry, he replied: ""You have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense."
LA021189-0003,54,18,Whether he will be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense.
LA021189-0003,55,6,"Let's focus on the qualifications"" ."
LA021189-0003,56,23,-- Tower's doctor said Friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the former Texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism.

LA021189-0003,58,37,"D. Dignan, who performed surgery to remove a polyp from Tower's colon on Jan. 5, said that after the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner ."
LA021189-0003,59,30,"-- A longtime Bush political adviser said that Bush ""knew what he was doing"" when he named Tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination, despite the controversy."

WSJ910213-0136,13,5,You would obviously expect Mr.
WSJ910213-0136,14,10,"Tower to say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately."
WSJ910213-0136,15,22,"If that was all there was to ""Consequences,"" we could scan the dust jacket and invest our savings in local real estate."
WSJ910213-0136,16,19,"""Consequences"" reads a bit like a political Stephen King story as the small senator swelled into a Beltway monster."
WSJ910213-0136,17,30,"Politics never has been for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway)."
WSJ910213-0136,18,26,"Were the writing less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy, ""Consequences"" might have been a classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of control."
WSJ910213-0136,19,2,Given Mr.
WSJ910213-0136,20,26,"Tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors."
WSJ910213-0136,21,6,Instead it sank like the Bismarck.
WSJ910213-0136,22,7,"Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr."
WSJ910213-0136,23,19,"Tower had made many enemies since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often rubbing even supporters the wrong way."
WSJ910213-0136,24,14,"The senator from the Lone Star State could be lordly, in his English-cut suits."
WSJ910213-0136,25,31,"Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop the conference table."
WSJ910213-0136,26,13,"When the Tower hearings opened, all manner of accusations came to public notice."
WSJ910213-0136,27,19,The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not His Wife.
WSJ910213-0136,28,5,It was reported that Mr.
WSJ910213-0136,29,17,Tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at Bergstrom Air Force Base.
WSJ910213-0136,30,17,"The second wife, whom the senator had recently divorced, possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered."
WSJ910213-0136,31,4,"At his hotel, Mr."
WSJ910213-0136,32,12,"Tower was accorded that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the media stakeout."
WSJ910213-0136,33,29,"The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long since sworn off scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients had been proper and modest."
WSJ910213-0136,34,8,"None of the charges, at least on Mr."
WSJ910213-0136,35,8,"Tower's showing, proved to have the least substance."

WSJ910213-0136,39,24,"Tower's successor as Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially to smile on the nomination; then the rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts."
WSJ910213-0136,40,17,"While endeavoring to look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn leaned on moderate Democrats who would otherwise have supported Tower."
WSJ910213-0136,41,8,"Sen. Nunn made the campaign personal, says Mr."
WSJ910213-0136,42,9,Tower -- vote for me or vote for him.
WSJ910213-0136,43,9,"Most Democrats, in the end, went with Sen. Nunn."

WSJ910213-0136,45,2,Morality? Mr.
WSJ910213-0136,46,24,"Tower suggests instead that Sen. Nunn, a presidential hopeful, discovered and seized an opportunity to show who was really No. 1 on national defense."
WSJ910213-0136,47,16,Sen. Nunn had every reason to know that the moral and ethical charges leveled at Mr.
WSJ910213-0136,48,9,"Tower, and investigated exhaustively by the FBI, were flimsy."
WSJ910213-0136,49,6,Yet he waved them about anyway.
WSJ910213-0136,50,24,"When the media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated stories, Sen. Nunn pursed his lips like a Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that a drunken Mr."
WSJ910213-0136,51,7,Tower might accidentally press the nuclear button.

WSJ910213-0136,58,19,"Sen. John Warner, a Republican, is depicted as falling all over himself to stay in good with Sen. Nunn."
WSJ910213-0136,59,28,"Mr. Tower feels, not without reason, that he was arraigned on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistook for Southern Baptist deacons."

AP900621-0186,12,31,"At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said."
AP900621-0186,13,18,Needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
AP900621-0186,14,22,"``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people."

AP900621-0186,17,38,"The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said."
AP900621-0186,18,22,"The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said."
AP900621-0186,19,18,"``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes."
AP900621-0186,20,17,"Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needhams said."
AP900621-0186,21,19,"A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas ."
AP900622-0025,8,17,The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.

AP900622-0025,15,25,"In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight."
AP900622-0025,16,18,Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
AP900622-0025,17,19,"In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings."
AP900622-0025,18,22,"``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo."
AP900622-0025,19,34,"The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said."
AP900622-0025,20,22,"The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said."

AP900623-0022,17,25,Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
AP900623-0022,18,11,"``They have been very late in assisting the people,'' he said."
AP900623-0022,19,23,"Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country."
AP900623-0022,20,21,"Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents."
AP900623-0022,21,21,Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
AP900623-0022,22,10,``This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery.

AP880508-0070,7,31,A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students.
AP880508-0070,8,37,"Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony."

AP880508-0070,21,9,"``We are very, very sorry it happened this way."

AP881113-0007,13,30,A South African government source last week indicated recent rumors of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action.
AP881113-0007,14,24,And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa said there has been ``no indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the near future''.

SJMN91-06145218,13,28,"In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela has played the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white government."
SJMN91-06145218,14,15,He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics.
SJMN91-06145218,15,17,"He has spent his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions."
SJMN91-06145218,16,13,Now Mandela is confronted with his wife's conviction for a brutal criminal offense.
SJMN91-06145218,17,6,He has loyally defended her innocence.
SJMN91-06145218,18,10,He has seemed to hear no voice to the contrary.
SJMN91-06145218,19,5,But events have caught up.
SJMN91-06145218,20,26,The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.
SJMN91-06145218,21,30,There are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.
SJMN91-06145218,22,25,"It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political."
SJMN91-06145218,23,21,But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end.
SJMN91-06145218,24,27,"One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly."
SJMN91-06145218,25,12,During the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused.
SJMN91-06145218,26,17,"But from all one can tell, this trial was handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann."
SJMN91-06145218,27,12,The reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence was also mild.
SJMN91-06145218,28,11,Surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela.
SJMN91-06145218,29,18,The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case.
SJMN91-06145218,30,44,"Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ""the movement is larger than any individual.""; A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa."
SJMN91-06145218,31,4,They need each other.
SJMN91-06145218,32,15,"Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaves a viable country."
SJMN91-06145218,33,6,The next step is formal negotiations.
SJMN91-06145218,34,35,"They can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called ""cultural"" weapons such as spears."
SJMN91-06145218,35,16,"How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents?"
SJMN91-06145218,36,6,The time factor is crucial now.
SJMN91-06145218,37,22,"Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public, black and white, is to retain hope for a peaceful solution."

AP880310-0062,8,16,"Two dogs, to be specific, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog."
AP880310-0062,9,30,"The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd."
AP880310-0062,10,11,"``He's a very friendly dog,'' said Nero's master, Officer Joseph Faraguna."
AP880310-0062,11,13,"``In all the arrests I've made with him, he's only bitten four times''."
AP880310-0062,12,8,Nero specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
AP880310-0062,13,17,He has helped the Police Department make hundreds of arrests and has ``apprehended'' more than 50 felons.
AP880310-0062,14,24,"Nero was kept on his long leather leash while Prince emerged from his elegant, padded carrying case only long enough to pose for photographers."
AP880310-0062,15,20,The Pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
AP880310-0062,16,25,"Prince, long used to being coddled and primped, seemed oblivious to all the attention until Nero grew bold enough to prod him on the chin."
AP880310-0062,17,6,Then he blinked and drew back.
AP880310-0062,18,18,"But neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch from the luncheon at Sardi's, a prominent midtown Manhattan restaurant."

AP880917-0157,11,40,"``We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh,'' said organizer Avi Marshak, using the Arabic word for uprising to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian violence aimed at ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip."
AP880917-0157,12,9,"About 20,000 people attended the two-day show, organizers said."
AP880917-0157,13,38,Israeli couples in cutoff jeans and short-sleeved shirts pushed baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the Yorkshire terriers to Great Danes and St. Bernards.
AP880917-0157,14,26,"Marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club based in Brussels, Belgium, and had judges from the Netherlands, South Africa, Italy and Britain."
AP880917-0157,15,20,"But although the competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad."
AP880917-0157,16,23,"This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began, when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to Israel."
AP880917-0157,17,33,"``Even so, we don't feel the intefadeh here,'' said Rafi Shahaf, a veterinarian, who was interviewed in the show ring where Conan, his steel gray Mastino Napoletano, had just taken a blue ribbon."

WSJ890726-0004,13,4,Robin Crest Lorien Corniche.
WSJ890726-0004,14,11,"Cory, as he is called for short, isn't any run-of-the-litter critter."

WSJ890726-0004,16,6,in his name stands for champion.
WSJ890726-0004,17,17,He has won 245 show awards as Best of Breed and 19 awards as Best in Show.
WSJ890726-0004,18,10,"Basically, his problem comes from serving more than one master."
WSJ890726-0004,19,20,"One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old."
WSJ890726-0004,20,12,The other two owners think he has plenty of prizes still ahead.
WSJ890726-0004,21,40,"In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News)."
WSJ890726-0004,22,34,"In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, ""Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success . . . and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished""."
WSJ890726-0004,23,12,Mr. Attalla claims that his work with Cory is no gravy train.
WSJ890726-0004,24,33,"In the suit, he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory."
WSJ890726-0004,25,14,"So far, Mr. Attalla says, he's spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages."
WSJ890726-0004,26,10,"In return, he is entitled to all ribbons and awards."
WSJ890726-0004,27,10,The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog.
WSJ890726-0004,28,12,"Despite the retirement, the suit says, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently."
WSJ890726-0004,29,9,(He placed fourth and then didn't place at all).
WSJ890726-0004,30,11,"For now, a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows."
WSJ890726-0004,31,32,"In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog ""simply and solely to better"" the chances that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover."
WSJ890726-0004,32,28,The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog.
WSJ890726-0004,33,14,They claim that Mr. Attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses.
WSJ890726-0004,34,6,Stud fees are also at issue.
WSJ890726-0004,35,29,"The Remondis argue that the retirement ""fraudulently"" deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert ""is in the best condition of his life"" ."

AP881003-0066,20,42,What had been the highest moment of the Games _ Ben Johnson rocketing to victory over U.S. great Carl Lewis in a 100-meter dash world record _ led to the deepest pain when the Canadian was caught cheating with muscle-building anabolic steroids.

AP881003-0066,27,18,"For the United States, a serious problem at the Seoul Games was a rising tide of anti-American sentiment."
AP881003-0066,28,35,"It was exacerbated by NBC's coverage, which the Koreans saw as anti-Korean and insensitive to local culture; the arrest of several American athletes; and the perceived rudeness of the U.S. team at the opening ceremony."
AP881003-0066,29,26,"The Soviets, meanwhile, cultivated friendship by bringing in the Bolshoi Ballet, the Moscow Philharmonic, films, a photo exhibit and copies of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda."

AP881003-0066,34,33,"Still, there were Louganis and other Americans to unabashedly cheer for _ like sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who led an assault on the track and field record books, and Louganis."

AP900328-0128,10,30,"President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend."

AP900328-0128,12,28,The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the Berlin games ``a victory for humanity'' in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
AP900328-0128,13,27,"``The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue _ a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition, not deadly conflict,'' Bush said."
AP900328-0128,14,19,"Bush called Owens, who was black, an ``Olympic hero and an American hero every day of his life ..."
AP900328-0128,15,7,born with the gift of burning speed''.
AP900328-0128,16,32,"``He was always the fastest,'' said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes."
AP900328-0128,17,9,"``Talk about a guy in a hurry,'' Bush laughed."
AP900328-0128,18,6,``He was the epitome of that''.
AP900328-0128,19,24,"At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold medals _ in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 400-meter relay."
AP900328-0128,20,26,"``The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid'' showed up, Bush said."
AP900328-0128,21,6,``It was an unrivaled athletic triumph.
AP900328-0128,22,12,"But more than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity''."
AP900328-0128,23,30,"Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but ``his humanitarian contributions in the race of life'' that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal."
AP900328-0128,24,17,"Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as ``a special ambassador for sports,'' said Bush."
AP900328-0128,25,34,"He said the athlete's legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy youth."
AP900328-0128,26,17,"``Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth,'' said Mrs. Owens, 74."
AP900328-0128,27,45,"Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal."
AP900328-0128,28,15,"The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White House afterwards, called the event ``absolutely beautiful''."
AP900328-0128,29,14,"She added: ``I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us, too.''"
FT923-8765,6,16,TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals.
FT923-8765,7,6,Tonight it is nation versus nation.
FT923-8765,8,36,"What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries - or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes."
FT923-8765,9,35,"The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada."
FT923-8765,10,22,"Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa)."
FT923-8765,11,20,"The Dutch, with one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South America (nil) combined."
FT923-8765,12,25,The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and 1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay medals.
FT923-8765,13,27,With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays always require a little luck - the developing countries will continue the gentle redistribution of medals.
FT923-8765,14,17,"But although they have talent, few can match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers."
FT923-8765,15,13,The US 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett.
FT923-8765,16,14,"Even so they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night's semi-finals."
FT923-8765,17,25,In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold.
FT923-8765,18,38,"One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh gold with victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics may bring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores the experience."
FT923-8765,19,48,"When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain."
FT923-8765,20,19,"Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump."
FT923-8765,21,28,"Even though the long jump had not finished and even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewis began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour."
FT923-8765,22,7,He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave.
FT923-8765,23,16,This is a man who derives immense pleasure from winning in front of a packed house.
FT923-8765,24,7,Lewis will be difficult to suppress tonight.
FT923-8765,25,13,"Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m."
FT923-8765,26,25,Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their continent's tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.
FT923-8765,27,21,"Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside Community College in California, to hone his running on good tracks."
FT923-8765,28,18,"On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after the gentlest push on the accelerator."
FT923-8765,29,25,"The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followed him down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellow Arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard."
FT923-8765,30,11,"Morcelli has not been beaten in the 1,500m since 1990 ."

WSJ881004-0111,6,18,The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton.
WSJ881004-0111,7,21,She went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements -- surely an Olympic record in itself.
WSJ881004-0111,8,22,"But when the 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, did the chance for American athletes to follow in her footsteps."
WSJ881004-0111,9,32,"Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glued to their TV sets, hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad was a dud."
WSJ881004-0111,10,27,"""I suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics,"" says Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS."
WSJ881004-0111,11,14,"""This is the first Olympics without passion, and without passion you don't have testimonials."
WSJ881004-0111,12,11,"Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone wants to emulate""."
WSJ881004-0111,13,18,"On the surface, the Games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts."
WSJ881004-0111,14,20,"Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head on the springboard, then coming back to win two gold medals?"
WSJ881004-0111,15,17,"Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails raking the air as she won the 100-meter sprint?"
WSJ881004-0111,16,35,"But even these two, along with Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the women's heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank."
WSJ881004-0111,17,15,"The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster."
WSJ881004-0111,18,28,"""I don't think it's big money like it used to be,"" says Michael Goldberg of National Media Group Inc., the New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton."
WSJ881004-0111,19,18,"""It used to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an Olympic athlete."
WSJ881004-0111,20,5,"It just doesn't happen anymore""."
WSJ881004-0111,21,22,"Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sports-equipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups."
WSJ881004-0111,22,26,"But the major, high-paying endorsements -- such as those with soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem to be surfacing, at least not yet."
WSJ881004-0111,23,26,"Earlier this year, sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements."
WSJ881004-0111,24,16,"Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year."
WSJ881004-0111,25,15,Advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark.
WSJ881004-0111,26,36,"For one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held in Los Angeles and because, in the absence of boycotting Soviet-bloc countries, the Americans won 83 gold medals."
WSJ881004-0111,27,23,"The 1988 Games, by contrast, were broadcast from halfway around the world, and the Soviets trounced the Americans, 55 gold medals to 36."
WSJ881004-0111,28,32,"What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast a pall over the Games, especially the incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids."
WSJ881004-0111,29,10,NBC's TV coverage also gets its share of the blame.
WSJ881004-0111,30,24,Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build.
WSJ881004-0111,31,17,"The constant commercial interruptions, which led to ratings that were much lower than expected, didn't help, either."
WSJ881004-0111,32,48,"During most of the past Games, ""there was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition,"" says Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games."
WSJ881004-0111,33,6,"But not this summer, he says."
WSJ881004-0111,34,18,"Recent changes in Olympic rules, meanwhile, have led to a glut of Olympians in search of endorsement deals."
WSJ881004-0111,35,19,"Before the 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status."
WSJ881004-0111,36,23,"Now, they can appear in as many ads as they want, but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses."
WSJ881004-0111,37,31,"""Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials -- basically, everybody is available,"" says Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc."
WSJ881004-0111,38,15,"As a result, while once an ""aura"" surrounded an Olympian, now ""the bloom is off""."
WSJ881004-0111,39,12,Companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements.
WSJ881004-0111,40,21,"Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook up with an Olympian just because the company president likes the athlete's sport."
WSJ881004-0111,41,32,"And after years of paying big bucks to Olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity, companies have finally gotten the hint that Olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety."
WSJ881004-0111,42,37,"""If you think your phone will ring off the hook if (you win) a gold medal, it isn't going to happen anymore,"" says Stephen Disson, senior vice president of marketing for ProServ Inc., a Washington sports-marketing firm."
WSJ881004-0111,43,21,"Companies now know that ""six months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events"" for them to consider."
WSJ881004-0111,44,11,Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics is becoming typical.
WSJ881004-0111,45,25,It uses sports stars in its commercials for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but has no plans to call on any of 1988's Olympians.
WSJ881004-0111,46,28,"""I prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis, like football and basketball players,"" says Charles Miesmer, the agency's executive creative director."
WSJ881004-0111,47,27,"""People like Michael Jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers, all in a row, so I don't have to worry about the public saying, 'Carl who'""?"
WSJ881004-0111,48,16,"And don't look for any of 1988's winners to start showing up on Wheaties boxes, either."
WSJ881004-0111,49,36,"General Mills Inc., which has featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner on its Wheaties boxes in the past, says it looks for three qualities in an endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments."
WSJ881004-0111,50,13,A spokeswoman says that none of this year's crop meet all three criteria.
WSJ881004-0111,51,10,"So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee has had the most visible endorsements."
WSJ881004-0111,52,14,"Even before the Olympics began, she had made commercials for Primatene mist and 7-Up."
WSJ881004-0111,53,33,"And, according to her agent, Pearl Hodge of World Class Management, she is now ""in the process"" of signing with McDonald's Corp., to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children."
WSJ881004-0111,54,12,"Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take the endorsement lead."
WSJ881004-0111,55,21,"Advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winners."
WSJ881004-0111,56,8,(The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached for comment).
WSJ881004-0111,57,14,"Another Olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medals."
WSJ881004-0111,58,36,"Mr. Biondi has already signed a swim-wear contract with Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent at Advantage International Inc., says his client ""will definitely be in a high-income ring, the highest you can name""."
WSJ881004-0111,59,5,Then there is Mr. Louganis.
WSJ881004-0111,60,19,"Since winning two gold medals during the 1984 Summer Olympics, the diver has had little luck with major endorsements."
WSJ881004-0111,61,20,And a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential.
WSJ881004-0111,62,29,"""When most advertisers are looking for the male hero, the word 'macho' trails along very closely,"" says Marty Blackman of Blackman & Raber, a sports-marketing firm in New York."
WSJ881004-0111,63,7,"""I don't find Louganis a macho guy""."
WSJ881004-0111,64,7,"Still, other marketing professionals say that Mr."
WSJ881004-0111,65,12,Louganis's dramatic recovery after smashing his head has secured the diver's future.
WSJ881004-0111,66,10,"His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment on any contract offers."
WSJ881004-0111,67,11,"He will say, however, that his client has ""done just fine."
WSJ881004-0111,68,3,He isn't unhappy.
WSJ881004-0111,69,9,"He dives to perform; he doesn't dive for dollars""."

AP901127-0119,13,35,"Major, 47, fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the 372 Coservative Party members of Parliament, but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major as the winner."
AP901127-0119,14,29,"Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government."
AP901127-0119,15,25,"Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife, Norma."
AP901127-0119,16,17,"Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major."
AP901127-0119,17,22,"``I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to succeed me,'' the ``Iron Lady'' said in a statement released by aides."
AP901127-0119,18,34,"``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,'' Major said."
AP901127-0119,19,8,``Our job now I think is quite clear.
AP901127-0119,20,30,"We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century."
AP901127-0119,21,9,"Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority."
AP901127-0119,22,14,Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.
AP901127-0119,23,12,"Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials declared Major elected."
AP901127-0119,24,31,"The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race."
AP901127-0119,25,24,"Mrs. Thatcher had not wanted to leave office, but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down Heseltine's challenge."
AP901127-0119,26,13,She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand against Heseltine.
AP901127-0119,27,24,"Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing Major."
AP901127-0119,28,30,"The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient, Major personifies the values of self-reliance and hard work that Mrs. Thatcher had preached to the nation."
AP901127-0119,29,27,"His election climaxed a month of British politics-turned-upside down, and the Western world's longest-serving head of government was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks."
AP901127-0119,30,38,"Heading a government that was trailing the opposition Labor Party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Thatcher lost control of events after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on Nov. 1."

AP901127-0119,37,11,Opposition leaders derided Major's election as ``Thatcherism with a different face''.
AP901127-0119,38,12,"The Conservatives' main rivals, the socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election."
AP901127-0119,39,25,"``John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected,'' said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock."
AP901127-0119,40,19,"``It means that the policies that brought the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on''."
AP901127-0119,41,32,"During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the ``poll tax,'' an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher, but he gave no other hints of differing with her."
AP901127-0119,42,33,"While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares her opposition to a single European currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending."
AP901127-0119,43,14,"However, he insisted over the weekend, ``I am not running as `Son of Thatcher'."
AP901127-0119,44,13,"I am running as myself, with my own priorities and my own programs''."
AP901127-0119,45,19,"Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party."
AP901127-0119,46,9,"``Tomorrow always dawns,'' he said, smiling after conceding defeat."
AP901127-0119,47,19,"Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year."
AP901127-0119,48,8,He moved up quickly in the leadership race.
AP901127-0119,49,26,"By the weekend, opinion polls showed that Major was nearly as highly regarded by the public as was Heseltine, who has been prominent for a decade."
AP901127-0119,50,26,"Major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major's own views were more liberal than many supposed."

FBIS4-24776,14,8,"[Editorial: ""There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing"
FBIS4-24776,15,26,"Its Leader""] [Text] In local government elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats."
FBIS4-24776,16,23,"As the ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls."
FBIS4-24776,17,25,"The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party."
FBIS4-24776,18,23,"The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides."
FBIS4-24776,19,10,The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats.
FBIS4-24776,20,19,Even some former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats.
FBIS4-24776,21,34,"Of course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour."
FBIS4-24776,22,12,"In the deep sorrow of defeat, some Conservatives are secretly feeling happy."
FBIS4-24776,23,24,"They resent John Major's leadership, and would most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections."
FBIS4-24776,24,28,"Even before all of the results were known, some Tories openly announced their determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him from office as early as possible."
FBIS4-24776,25,29,"The right-winger Michael Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the European issue, and highlighted John Major's image as a loser who fails to command."
FBIS4-24776,26,29,"Obviously, all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June."
FBIS4-24776,27,13,"Before 9 June, nobody will officially challenge for the position of party leader."
FBIS4-24776,28,13,But he who is in office must suffer the pain of electoral defeat.
FBIS4-24776,29,24,"After 9 June, John Major will have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use him as a scapegoat."
FBIS4-24776,30,48,"John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs. Thatcher, who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the Thatcher line."
FBIS4-24776,31,23,"Nevertheless, people around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's doctrine, while pursuing entirely new ""leftist"" policies and affecting John Major's moves."
FBIS4-24776,32,15,"For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers argued over many domestic and world issues."
FBIS4-24776,33,24,"John Major has always been weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own ""crisis of honor""."
FBIS4-24776,34,30,"On the European issue, he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set."
FBIS4-24776,35,25,"On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the right."
FBIS4-24776,36,22,"While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance."
FBIS4-24776,37,29,"When expounding on such concepts, he set out a campaign to ""return to basic values,"" with an emphasis on citizen self-discipline, taking social responsibility and obligations, and being upright."
FBIS4-24776,38,25,"However, one scandal surfaced after another in his cabinet; consequently, British citizens saw how bombastic Major could be and how he failed to know himself."
FBIS4-24776,39,7,The scandals caused Major's reputation to collapse.
FBIS4-24776,40,38,"For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment."
FBIS4-24776,41,32,"At this critical juncture, John Major went back on promises made during the election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic fuel; as a result, things became even harder for the poor."
FBIS4-24776,42,15,"He promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it rose by 45.5 percent."
FBIS4-24776,43,21,"[as published] John Major has become an expert in making ""empty promises,"" while constituents continue to scorn this dishonest prime minister."
FBIS4-24776,44,13,Many Conservatives believe that John Major is driven by a gambler's mind set.
FBIS4-24776,45,26,"At a time when his reputation was waning, he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world issues, regardless of British national strength."
FBIS4-24776,46,36,"This being the case, he wanted to try his luck in Bosnia, as well as policy toward China; however, he was helpless in dealing with domestic economic issues which would only lead Britain to an impasse."
FBIS4-24776,47,28,"It will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that John Major would be replaced."
FBIS4-24776,48,15,The setback which has resulted from defeats in the local elections is heavier than expected.
FBIS4-24776,49,19,"To accelerate a leadership reshuffle, Conservatives have spread the opinion that ""John Major is not up to his office""."
FBIS4-24776,50,20,"However, if politicians from various factions compete for office by taking a laissez-faire attitude, the Tory unity will be jeopardized."
FBIS4-24776,51,24,"This being the case, a planned transfer of power, especially the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the party chairman, is necessary."
FBIS4-24776,52,19,"When the new party chairman is elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be settled too."
FBIS4-24776,53,19,"Word has spread that John Major wants Chris Patten to become Conservative Party chairman; however, this proposal was rejected."
FBIS4-24776,54,33,"That should have been a party secret; making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to Chris Patten contending for this position."
FBIS4-24776,55,26,There are no grounds to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral circumstances.
FBIS4-24776,56,20,That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents.
FBIS4-24776,57,34,"In actual fact, should John Major set out such a line in appointing people, that would only give more evidence of his poor ability, insight, and lack of judgment, as well as his self-knowledge."
FBIS4-24776,58,24,"Now, it is just a matter of time until he leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the transfer of power."
FBIS4-24776,59,22,Work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a task?
FT932-15960,7,16,"ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election."
FT932-15960,8,31,"His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove."
FT932-15960,9,46,"The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in business."
FT932-15960,10,16,Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record.
FT932-15960,11,27,"While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved."
FT932-15960,12,15,The government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
FT932-15960,13,26,"Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failures."
FT932-15960,14,11,He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments'.
FT932-15960,15,25,"Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends."
FT932-15960,16,31,"Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery'."
FT932-15960,17,42,"Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over which, in the end, he had no control."
FT932-15960,18,28,"Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor."
FT932-15960,19,25,"He still attracts gratitude for the election victory, which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the economy - as the best result for business."
FT932-15960,20,25,"But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction."
FT932-15960,21,36,"There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment of the domestic economy."
FT932-15960,22,20,Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base.
FT932-15960,23,15,But the jury is out on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action.

FT933-10917,6,24,"THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people."
FT933-10917,7,44,"It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good."
FT933-10917,8,14,"With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction."
FT933-10917,9,2,What piffle.
FT933-10917,10,37,"Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats."
FT933-10917,11,18,"Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury."
FT933-10917,12,22,"In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public."
FT933-10917,13,18,"In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness."
FT933-10917,14,5,But in private they relax.
FT933-10917,15,3,Their syntax disappears.
FT933-10917,16,4,Their words become nonsensical.
FT933-10917,17,6,They swear and joke and shout.
FT933-10917,18,5,It really is a spectacle.
FT933-10917,19,15,"To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith."
FT933-10917,20,15,"Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that."
FT933-10917,21,23,"In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching."
FT933-10917,22,8,"To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler."
FT933-10917,23,5,No one could have eavesdropped.
FT933-10917,24,6,Their responses were true to form.
FT933-10917,25,42,But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . . Four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages'.
FT933-10917,26,16,"I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle."
FT933-10917,27,4,"First, I tackled Major."
FT933-10917,28,31,"I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week?"
FT933-10917,29,11,They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements.
FT933-10917,30,6,They did not pull their punches.
FT933-10917,31,5,I bet you went chalk-white.
FT933-10917,32,7,"'So why not walk the plank, John?"
FT933-10917,33,14,You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century.
FT933-10917,34,4,Why invite more punishment?
FT933-10917,35,16,"Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups'."
FT933-10917,36,7,'Are you sure'? the prime minister replied.
FT933-10917,37,43,"'I mean . . . how did it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me."
FT933-10917,38,11,"But I'm not giving in like that, like . . '."
FT933-10917,39,5,On and on it went.
FT933-10917,40,5,Then I rang John Smith.
FT933-10917,41,41,"I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation."
FT933-10917,42,10,"I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John."
FT933-10917,43,40,"Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'."
FT933-10917,44,13,"But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness."
FT933-10917,45,6,What do you say to that'?
FT933-10917,46,8,"'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader."
FT933-10917,47,14,"'Gie me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent."
FT933-10917,48,26,"Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle."
FT933-10917,49,52,"Likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]' After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch."

FT942-6613,6,28,"Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There."
FT942-6613,7,6,I entirely concur with their choice.
FT942-6613,8,44,"In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency."
FT942-6613,9,27,"Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner."
FT942-6613,10,12,In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
FT942-6613,11,5,He has a deadly innocence.
FT942-6613,12,7,No wonder the Majors liked this film.
FT942-6613,13,20,"John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's."
FT942-6613,14,12,"If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing."
FT942-6613,15,14,Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
FT942-6613,16,21,"In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer."
FT942-6613,17,15,"Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'."
FT942-6613,18,8,"(Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway)."
FT942-6613,19,5,And Major replied: 'It's simple.
FT942-6613,20,5,My father was a farmer.
FT942-6613,21,9,He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire'.
FT942-6613,22,27,"Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910."
FT942-6613,23,27,"As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire."
FT942-6613,24,11,"This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up."
FT942-6613,25,6,Family folklore is a peculiar thing.
FT942-6613,26,34,"Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour."
FT942-6613,27,20,I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city.
FT942-6613,28,18,"A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a pattern emerges."
FT942-6613,29,16,"Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people."
FT942-6613,30,17,"If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making."
FT942-6613,31,15,But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues.
FT942-6613,32,26,On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe.
FT942-6613,33,24,"On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics."
FT942-6613,34,37,"There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one."
FT942-6613,35,12,But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
FT942-6613,36,24,"Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'."
FT942-6613,37,26,"No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background."
FT942-6613,38,24,"His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus."
FT942-6613,39,19,"No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating."
FT942-6613,40,18,The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.
FT942-6613,41,4,Except in the movies.

LA112790-0154,16,12,Thatcher has made no public comment on what she will do next.

LA112790-0154,23,27,"Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected ."
LA112790-0154,24,25,"Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11 ."

LA112790-0154,26,20,"Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer last year ."
LA112790-0154,27,29,"He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major's own views are more liberal than many supposed ."
LA112790-0154,28,14,He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues .

LA112890-0036,11,30,"John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday as Britain's next prime minister ."
LA112890-0036,12,30,"Major, whose father was once a circus trapeze artist, was elected leader of the Conservative Party to replace Margaret Thatcher, whose sudden resignation under pressure last week surprised the nation."
LA112890-0036,13,21,"Thatcher formally presents her resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new government ."
LA112890-0036,14,32,"The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd."
LA112890-0036,15,23,"The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned ."
LA112890-0036,16,33,"In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory."
LA112890-0036,17,32,"But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major ."
LA112890-0036,18,20,"Thatcher said she was ""thrilled"" by Major's victory, adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders ."
LA112890-0036,19,13,Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century .
LA112890-0036,20,27,"His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next general election."
LA112890-0036,21,10,"Before Thatcher's resignation, the polls had been favoring Labor ."
LA112890-0036,22,37,"Appearing outside his official residence at No. 11 Downing St., next to the prime minister's, Major declared Tuesday evening, ""We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election"" ."
LA112890-0036,23,35,"""It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,"" Major said ."
LA112890-0036,24,13,"He complimented his rivals for a campaign based on ""substance, not personality"" ."
LA112890-0036,25,39,"When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same ."
LA112890-0036,26,22,"Party leaders, however, waived the third ballot -- which was expected to be unanimous -- and Major was declared party leader ."
LA112890-0036,27,19,"After his appointment by the queen today, he is expected to name his Cabinet in a few days ."
LA112890-0036,28,22,"President Bush, en route to Washington after a visit to Mexico, telephoned Major from aboard Air Force One to congratulate him ."
LA112890-0036,29,26,"""The President said he looked forward to working with Major and to maintaining the special relationship"" with Britain, said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater ."
LA112890-0036,30,12,"In Washington, the State and Defense departments also welcomed the news ."
LA112890-0036,31,22,"""We're very glad that it's all settled, and that it was able to be settled so quickly,"" a State Department official said."
LA112890-0036,32,11,"""We know John Major and expect to work well with him."
LA112890-0036,33,9,"We don't expect any change in U.S.-U.K. relations"" ."
LA112890-0036,34,13,"After Major's election, Thatcher declared that she wanted everyone ""to rally behind him""."
LA112890-0036,35,36,"The prime minister had picked Major from among ""backbenchers"" -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as ""a man of the people"" ."
LA112890-0036,36,17,"With her support, he rose swiftly through the Department of Social Security and then the Treasury ."
LA112890-0036,37,16,"Thatcher will remain a member of the House of Commons, representing the Finchley section of London."
LA112890-0036,38,24,"She and her husband, Denis, will move out of 10 Downing St. today to their house in the South London community of Dulwich ."
LA112890-0036,39,29,"Thatcher may accept a peerage in the House of Lords as a hereditary countess, friends said, since earldoms (the male equivalent) are the traditional award to former prime ministers."
LA112890-0036,40,11,That tradition was not followed by recent Labor prime ministers .
LA112890-0036,41,24,Major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a seat in the House of Commons in 1979 .
LA112890-0036,42,44,"He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the party's choosing ."
LA112890-0036,43,41,"He is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more sympathetic view toward Britain's role in the European Community and has promised to review the controversial community charge, the so-called poll tax introduced by Thatcher ."
LA112890-0036,44,27,"Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who likely will face Major in the next national election, immediately labeled him ""more of the same"" in the Thatcher mold ."
LA112890-0036,45,15,The Labor Party had expected to defeat an unpopular Thatcher in the next election .
LA112890-0036,46,16,"Jack Cunningham, Labor's campaign coordinator, argued that Major's victory was that of the ""Thatcher candidate"" ."
LA112890-0036,47,22,"Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major's own party, a majority in the House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday ."
LA112890-0036,48,7,That in a sense was true .
LA112890-0036,49,27,"With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent."
LA112890-0036,50,37,That vote -- while she was in Paris attending the summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe -- forced her into a runoff with Heseltine and ultimately cost her the party leadership .
LA112890-0036,51,21,"But in that vote, under the party's complicated rules, she needed a majority plus 15% and she fell four votes short."
LA112890-0036,52,13,"In Tuesday's ballot, only a simple majority was needed to win outright ."
LA112890-0036,53,38,"The prime minister's downfall came after she had run into a stretch of unpopularity -- partly through her authoritarian manner, partly because of inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new ""poll tax"" ."
LA112890-0036,54,38,"She also appeared to take an anti-European attitude toward her 11 partners in the European Community, which caused her long-serving Cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech ."
LA112890-0036,55,37,"That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday ."
LA112890-0036,56,15,The prime minister's failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to reassess her position.
LA112890-0036,57,39,"Her closest advisers reported that her support in the House of Commons was eroding, friends said, so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues ."
LA112890-0036,58,21,"At that point, on Thursday morning, both Major and Hurd, loyal members of her Cabinet, entered the race against Heseltine ."
LA112890-0036,59,30,"Many Tories in Parliament were angry at Heseltine for his role in bringing down Thatcher, who had won three national elections during her 15 years as Conservative Party leader ."
LA112890-0036,60,13,Her 11 1/2-year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century.
LA112890-0036,61,24,"Her confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad -- and many enemies, here and in the European Community ."
LA112890-0036,62,28,"During the past few days, Major picked up strength among his colleagues, as opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular Tory after Heseltine nationwide ."
LA112890-0036,63,16,"On Monday, Thatcher let it be known that she personally preferred Major to succeed her ."
LA112890-0036,64,26,"Some commentators feared that Thatcher's revelation of her choice might harm Major -- with her comment Tuesday morning that she would make a ""good back-seat driver""."
LA112890-0036,65,5,"Labor members called Major ""Mrs."
LA112890-0036,66,3,"Thatcher's poodle"" ."
LA112890-0036,67,25,"But Major was the clear-cut victor in the balloting, held from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday in a House of Commons committee room ."
LA112890-0036,68,17,"After the results were announced, Heseltine declared that the election had been fought ""without rancor and bitterness""."
LA112890-0036,69,30,"To ""lay the basis for unity,"" he said, he would ask his supporters to vote for Major in the expected third ballot on Thursday, as he himself would do ."
LA112890-0036,70,7,"Soon afterward, Hurd did the same ."
LA112890-0036,71,38,"A third ballot seemed certain until Cranley Onslow, who heads the Conservative Party organization called the 1922 Committee, which supervised the party election, announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared Major the party leader ."
LA112890-0036,72,26,"It was not immediately clear whether Hurd and Heseltine would join Major's Cabinet, though Major's aides indicated they would be offered roles in the government ."
LA112890-0036,73,33,"Conservative Party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion, with no blood on the floor ."
LA112890-0036,74,25,"The Labor Party, almost overnight, went from being the strong favorite in the next election to second place behind a Tory party led by Major."
LA112890-0036,75,15,Recent opinion polls had suggested that any new leader would greatly enhance Tory popularity .
LA112890-0036,76,26,"Labor's Cunningham declared that the Conservatives' lead was ""a temporary blip"" and promised ""to fight an election as soon as he (Major) names a date"" ."

LA122190-0149,10,34,"Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis ."
LA122190-0149,11,25,"""A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won't do,"" Major said in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf ."

AP900117-0193,9,31,"Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest, costliest criminal trial."
AP900117-0193,10,34,Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.
AP900117-0193,11,39,"In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts."
AP900117-0193,12,13,He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back.
AP900117-0193,13,20,"However, the judge noted that ``The attorneys are hopeful all the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts''."
AP900117-0193,14,19,Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.
AP900117-0193,15,32,"The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach."
AP900117-0193,16,16,The jury that spent 2 years hearing evidence in the case have agreed on 52 verdicts.
AP900117-0193,17,5,They have all been sealed.
AP900117-0193,18,17,None of the verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by the jury.
AP900117-0193,19,8,Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations.
AP900117-0193,20,19,Buckey and his mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one shared count of conspiracy.
AP900117-0193,21,18,One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
AP900117-0193,22,31,"Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday."
AP900117-0193,23,31,"After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons''."
AP900117-0193,24,18,"However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant."
AP900117-0193,25,19,"A split verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge."
AP900117-0193,26,16,"It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking their heads in confusion."
AP900117-0193,27,17,Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing.
AP900117-0193,28,14,Five women teachers who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them dismissed.
AP900117-0193,29,21,"Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school."
AP900117-0193,30,12,"On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill."
AP900117-0193,31,16,"On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m. because another juror's child was ill."
AP900117-0193,32,24,No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial .
AP900118-0183,10,30,"Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype."
AP900118-0183,11,16,"Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced."
AP900118-0183,12,17,Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts.
AP900118-0183,13,12,Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial.
AP900118-0183,14,10,"``I just said, `I told you Ray,''' Mrs. Buckey said."
AP900118-0183,15,8,"Asked if her son was surprised, she said."
AP900118-0183,16,4,"``He had fear, definitely''."
AP900118-0183,17,11,Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer.
AP900118-0183,18,14,"``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you, too."
AP900118-0183,19,17,"If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here today,'' she said."
AP900118-0183,20,17,But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost.
AP900118-0183,21,18,"``It was never done properly,'' said parent Alan Lagunoff, who moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach."
AP900118-0183,22,14,``I have to sit back and figure out what to do with my son.
AP900118-0183,23,19,"I fear that because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on''."
AP900118-0183,24,17,"His son, now 10, attended the school for 1 years but wasn't a witness at the trial."
AP900118-0183,25,14,``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts.
AP900118-0183,26,9,"It will just be another six-year travesty,'' Lagunoff said."
AP900118-0183,27,26,"``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case."
AP900118-0183,28,14,``I don't know what the message is that the jury wanted to get out.
AP900118-0183,29,5,I'm anxious to hear that''.
AP900118-0183,30,30,"Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey, suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition."
AP900118-0183,31,16,"``My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' in order to secure a conviction."
AP900118-0183,32,11,"... If you don't win, you don't get promoted,'' he said."
AP900118-0183,33,20,Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
AP900118-0183,34,24,"``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,'' Ms. Williams told reporters."
AP900118-0183,35,37,"Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool."
AP900118-0183,36,31,"Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office."
AP900118-0183,37,11,"Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the matter differently."
AP900118-0183,38,22,"``Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not going to take any public criticism directed at me."
AP900118-0183,39,13,"Let him respond to the criticism,'' said Philibosian, now in private law practice."
AP900118-0183,40,25,"Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to conduct the original interviews with the children."
AP900118-0183,41,13,Defense attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers were leading and prejudicial.
AP900118-0183,42,2,Jurors agreed.
AP900118-0183,43,14,"``We never got the children's stories in their own words,'' said juror John Breese."
AP900118-0183,44,10,Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.
AP900118-0183,45,29,"Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey."
AP900118-0183,46,27,"Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals."
AP900118-0183,47,25,The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants after reviewing the case.
AP900118-0183,48,6,The underground tunnels were never found.
AP900118-0183,49,8,No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
AP900118-0183,50,13,"Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long, expensive prosecution."
AP900118-0183,51,19,``It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice.
AP900118-0183,52,21,"We need reform,'' Reiner said, adding that in trying to describe the case, ``Insane is the word that comes to mind''."
AP900118-0183,53,18,"The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial history, at 2 years and $15 million."
AP900118-0183,54,25,"Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case."
AP900118-0183,55,12,"For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal questions."
AP900118-0183,56,4,``Life is not fair.
AP900118-0183,57,8,I tell my children all the time ...
AP900118-0183,58,20,"there is no such thing as fair,'' said Robert Currie, whose son attended McMartin but didn't testify at the trial."
AP900118-0183,59,16,"``It's really a travesty for a case to take this long,'' said Ms. Rubin, the prosecutor."
AP900118-0183,60,17,"``...Not only for the families, the children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.''"
AP900118-0190,10,27,Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.
AP900118-0190,11,45,"Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School."
AP900118-0190,12,21,And they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute International.
AP900118-0190,13,23,"The private child therapy center, which specializes in abused children, videotaped interviews with children from the McMartin school after reports of molestations surfaced."
AP900118-0190,14,21,Jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children.
AP900118-0190,15,19,"Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII."
AP900118-0190,16,12,"``The CII interviews _ I could not accept them,'' Mrs. Williams said."
AP900118-0190,17,11,``I believe the children believe what they were saying was true.
AP900118-0190,18,30,"But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what their parents had told them."
AP900118-0190,19,28,"``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,''' Mrs. Williams said."
AP900118-0190,20,7,``The CII tapes did not help me.
AP900118-0190,21,17,"They gave me a lot of reasonable doubt,'' agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarket meat wrapper."
AP900118-0190,22,15,``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them.
AP900118-0190,23,5,All the questions were leading.
AP900118-0190,24,21,"They never had a chance to tell their stories,'' said juror John Breese, 51, a medical technician and grandfather of five."
AP900118-0190,25,16,"``I tried to believe the children,'' said juror Daryl Hutchins 28, an oil company lease operator."
AP900118-0190,26,12,``But if the child was so contaminated (by the interviews) I couldn't''.
AP900118-0190,27,22,Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school children.
AP900118-0190,28,16,The letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at the school and to Buckey's arrest.
AP900118-0190,29,16,"``The police letter should never have been sent,'' said juror Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker."
AP900118-0190,30,8,``It put the information out there too early.
AP900118-0190,31,4,The whole city knew''.
AP900118-0190,32,18,"At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested."
AP900118-0190,33,20,"``One child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to CII,'' Mrs. Williams recalled."
AP900118-0190,34,22,"The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations, including some children's accounts of being molested in a car wash."
AP900118-0190,35,7,"``We just dismissed those,'' said Mrs. Williams."
AP900118-0190,36,26,They said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact because they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos of children's genitals.
AP900118-0190,37,13,"Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurors deadlocked on 13 counts."
AP900118-0190,38,28,Some said they were unsure whether Buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
AP900118-0190,39,20,Jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the case were molested _ but not by these defendants.
AP900118-0190,40,25,"``Even if you accept that the children were molested,'' said juror Mark Bassett, ``the evidence didn't establish that they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School''."
AP900118-0190,41,19,The panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous toll on defendants as well as children and parents.
AP900118-0190,42,9,"``I think everybody is a victim,'' said Ms. Peters."
AP900118-0190,43,11,``I don't think anybody came out of this case a winner.
AP900118-0190,44,8,I think it's sad because everybody lost something.
AP900118-0190,45,8,The defendants _ their lives have been ruined.
AP900118-0190,46,6,"They lost their business, their reputation."
AP900118-0190,47,2,It's sad''.
AP900118-0190,48,10,"Mrs. Williams added, ``The children have to live with this."
AP900118-0190,49,7,The parents have to live with this.
AP900118-0190,50,10,There's nothing I can say that will make it better''.
AP900118-0190,51,16,"As for themselves, the jurors said their lives were ``put on hold'' for nearly three years."
AP900118-0190,52,13,Bassett lost his job as a research computer scientist when his company folded.
AP900118-0190,53,4,Mrs. Williams got married.
AP900118-0190,54,13,Breese said his wife died during the trial and he has since remarried.
AP900118-0190,55,12,"``It's been very hard,'' said Mrs. Williams, a telephone company service representative."
AP900118-0190,56,11,``There were days when I thought I couldn't stand it anymore.
AP900118-0190,57,9,"``I don't really know my job anymore,'' she said."
AP900118-0190,58,11,``It's going to be hard getting back into the real world''.
AP900118-0190,59,10,The jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews .
AP900118-0205,11,13,The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
AP900118-0205,12,7,Here is a chronology of the case:
AP900118-0205,13,1,_Aug.

AP900118-0205,20,10,"_March 24, 1984: All seven defendants are arrested and jailed."
AP900118-0205,21,8,Buckey and his mother are held without bail.
AP900118-0205,22,9,"Bail for he others ranges from $50,000 to $350,000."
AP900118-0205,23,13,"Lael Rubin, Christine Johnston and Glenn Stevens are assigned to the prosecution team."

AP900118-0205,25,31,"_April 20, 1984: The seven defendants plead innocent at an arraignment, during which they are charged with sexually abusing 18 children over 10 years and using death threats to silence them."

AP900118-0205,49,13,"_Jan. 18, 1990: The jury acquits Buckey and his mother of 52 counts."
AP900118-0205,50,22,The judge declares a mistrial on 13 other counts _ 12 against Buckey and one against both Buckey and his mother .
AP900119-0024,10,27,"A therapist defended her interviews of alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecution's case."
AP900119-0024,11,24,"The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts."
AP900119-0024,12,32,"Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution."
AP900119-0024,13,19,"``What is in the interest of children is not always in the interest of the legal system,'' she said."
AP900119-0024,14,24,Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
AP900119-0024,15,32,"Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute International."
AP900119-0024,16,23,MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse.
AP900119-0024,17,22,"``This agency would never have gone all the way through what we have if we did not believe these children,'' she said."
AP900119-0024,18,17,At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the evidence showed children had been molested.
AP900119-0024,19,13,But the jurors were sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.
AP900119-0024,20,19,"``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them,'' said juror John Breese."
AP900119-0024,21,5,``All the questions were leading''.
AP900119-0024,22,29,"``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'' juror Brenda Williams said."
AP900119-0024,23,19,"But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound, noting that small children must be interviewed differently than adults."
AP900119-0024,24,9,"``I didn't put words into their mouths,'' she said."
AP900119-0024,25,10,``I tried to enable them to get over their fears''.
AP900119-0024,26,20,"MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently, including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time."
AP900119-0024,27,19,She called the outcome of the case a ``tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these children''.
AP900119-0024,28,17,"But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, said some good may come out of the case."
AP900119-0024,29,24,"``It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these cases,'' she said ."
AP900119-0041,10,28,"There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it."
AP900119-0041,11,23,"In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges."
AP900119-0041,12,7,The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.
AP900119-0041,13,13,"Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticized the current district attorney."
AP900119-0041,14,10,The current district attorney blamed his predecessor and defense attorneys.
AP900119-0041,15,13,And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
AP900119-0041,16,26,"``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case."
AP900119-0041,17,13,"``Life is not fair,'' said Robert Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school."
AP900119-0041,18,8,``I tell my children all the time ...
AP900119-0041,19,7,there is no such thing as fair''.
AP900119-0041,20,16,The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he would not have done anything differently.
AP900119-0041,21,39,"Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney."
AP900119-0041,22,15,"``I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case was brought,'' he said."
AP900119-0041,23,25,"``To have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally that I have some political motive is totally unjustified''."
AP900119-0041,24,16,"Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner."
AP900119-0041,25,26,Philibosian said Reiner hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60 Minutes'' interview.
AP900119-0041,26,42,"But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence ``the decision we're proud of,'' said the trial took so long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system, delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by Philibosian."
AP900119-0041,27,8,"``This is a case I inherited,'' Reiner said."
AP900119-0041,28,23,"In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the children were molested, but the prosecution never established that the defendants were responsible."
AP900119-0041,29,25,"``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,'' said juror Brenda Williams ."
AP900119-0051,10,28,"``Ray Will Die'' is scrawled in big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin Pre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious child-molesting case."
AP900119-0051,11,20,"Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting students."
AP900119-0051,12,7,Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.
AP900119-0051,13,35,"Whatever happens on those charges, few in this upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge in the trial, William Pounders, who once said, ``The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it''."
AP900119-0051,14,33,"Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the street from the school, said she had two friends who were involved in the case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt."
AP900119-0051,15,8,"``I think they got off scot-free,'' Brown said."
AP900119-0051,16,5,``I'm really sick about it''.
AP900119-0051,17,24,"Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys, stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school and talked about his disappointment."
AP900119-0051,18,23,"``The defense did everything to prolong the case and the prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case properly,'' he said."
AP900119-0051,19,21,A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated L-shaped building.
AP900119-0051,20,14,"``I'd like to see the school become a center for abused children,'' he said."
AP900119-0051,21,13,``It should be put to some good use rather than tear it down''.
AP900119-0051,22,7,But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.
AP900119-0051,23,10,"``I'd like to see it torn down,'' said Brenda Platt."
AP900119-0051,24,8,``I'd like to have no memories of this''.
AP900119-0051,25,26,"Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has serious doubts about placing them in a day-care center because of the McMartin trial."
AP900119-0051,26,13,``I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beach and society.
AP900119-0051,27,5,"It's totally upsetting,'' Platt said."
AP900119-0051,28,11,"Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was also upset."
AP900119-0051,29,15,"``I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly in the jurors,'' Geisert said."
AP900119-0051,30,18,"For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel the prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts."
AP900119-0051,31,11,"``It would be just more of the same circus,'' he said."
AP900119-0051,32,14,"``We put so much faith and hope in our courts,'' said Robert Canter, 74."
AP900119-0051,33,8,``And this is what we get _ frustration.''
LA011990-0091,10,40,"Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history ."
LA011990-0091,11,39,"An eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years."
LA011990-0091,12,19,"The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations ."
LA011990-0091,13,32,"Ray Buckey, 31, left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the 13 undecided counts."
LA011990-0091,14,10,But his 63-year-old mother and co-defendant reacted with anger .
LA011990-0091,15,14,"""I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything,"" she said outside the court."
LA011990-0091,16,24,"""My concern was for my son and what they've done to him . . . because my son would never harm a child"" ."
LA011990-0091,17,32,"Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable ."
LA011990-0091,18,18,"""I am not convinced that he (Ray Buckey) is innocent,"" said juror Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker."
LA011990-0091,19,11,"""But it was not proven to me that he did it."
LA011990-0091,20,15,"Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different"" ."
LA011990-0091,21,12,The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom.
LA011990-0091,22,44,"The Buckeys, who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system, had sat silently, staring straight ahead, as the jury filed into the room shortly before 10:30 a.m. and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation ."
LA011990-0091,23,21,"""All the verdicts are the same,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, handing them to his court clerk ."
LA011990-0091,24,25,"Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then, reading from the verdict form, delivered in a single, almost anti-climactic sentence the historic trial's close:"
LA011990-0091,25,14,"""We the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty"" ."
LA011990-0091,26,13,The quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs.
LA011990-0091,27,14,"At first, the defendants remained stoic, then their eyes began to rim with tears."
LA011990-0091,28,5,Ray Buckey's lower lip quivered.
LA011990-0091,29,9,His mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief.
LA011990-0091,30,4,They said nothing .
LA011990-0091,31,9,"Afterward, Peggy McMartin Buckey insisted she was not bitter."
LA011990-0091,32,22,"""I knew God would set my son and me free because we have done nothing,"" she said as she was driven away."
LA011990-0091,33,23,"Her optimism was not matched by her son, however, who she said had ""had fear, definitely,"" about what the jury would decide ."
LA011990-0091,34,32,"""I held his hand,"" Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced, ""and I told him: 'I told you, Ray,' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he didn't"" ."
LA011990-0091,35,35,"The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history, a case that stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a ""Mr."
LA011990-0091,36,29,"Ray"". The case ultimately cost taxpayers more than $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse ."
LA011990-0091,37,26,"Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts: ""I found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place."
LA011990-0091,38,24,"I thought that based on the evidence that was presented, the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it ."
LA011990-0091,39,26,"""It is very difficult to test the credibility of children, and when you go beyond that, the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration."
LA011990-0091,40,11,"It was very difficult to find corroboration in this case"" ."
LA011990-0091,41,23,"Asked if the case was worth its cost in money, lives and stress, Pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case ."
LA011990-0091,42,23,"""People will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense taking place at preschool and at schools,"" Pounders said."
LA011990-0091,43,12,"""People are no longer dropping their children off and walking away blindly."
LA011990-0091,44,3,They look back.
LA011990-0091,45,6,"They check things out more"" ."
LA011990-0091,46,33,"In the crowded courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims lashed out at the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served by the judicial system ."
LA011990-0091,47,15,"""The system doesn't allow us to protect kids,"" said the father of two alleged victims."
LA011990-0091,48,9,"""I have no doubt these children were abused ."
LA011990-0091,49,17,"Said a tearful mother: ""I guess maybe it's OK to (molest) kids! I can't believe this"" ."
LA011990-0091,50,11,The children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts .
LA011990-0091,51,16,"""We all know that we are telling the truth,"" said a 15-year-old boy who had testified."
LA011990-0091,52,13,"""No matter what the jury says, whatever anybody says, this is the truth."
LA011990-0091,53,4,"We were molested"" ."
LA011990-0091,54,21,"Another of the children said that, when the clerk read ""not guilty"" on the verdict form, ""my stomach just hollowed out."
LA011990-0091,55,4,I was beyond tears.
LA011990-0091,56,12,Those words will stick with me probably the rest of my life.
LA011990-0091,57,7,"I'll never forget those two words"" ."
LA011990-0091,58,7,Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods.
LA011990-0091,59,23,"In particular, they cited the prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center."
LA011990-0091,60,29,"They also criticized the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information ."
LA011990-0091,61,23,"""The children,"" said juror John Breese, 51, a biomedical technician, ""were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them."
LA011990-0091,62,4,"That was crucial"" ."
LA011990-0091,63,18,"Said jury foreman Luis Chang, an electrical engineer: ""The key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes."
LA011990-0091,64,6,"They were too biased, too leading."
LA011990-0091,65,7,"That's the main crux of it"" ."
LA011990-0091,66,31,"All said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds, not only because the judge had so instructed, but also because the disjointed testimony had left them confused ."
LA011990-0091,67,37,"""I went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial,"" said Brenda Williams, 38, a Pacific Bell service representative."
LA011990-0091,68,45,"""I felt I had missed out on something, maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that would make it all come together"" ."
LA011990-0091,69,16,"Said juror Mark Bassett, 33, a computer specialist: ""We just didn't really know what happened"" ."
LA011990-0091,70,2,Deputy Dist.
LA011990-0091,71,25,"Atty Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case, said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial."
LA011990-0091,72,20,"These counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey, and a conspiracy count that accused both him and his mother."
LA011990-0091,73,12,The conspiracy count against Peggy McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday .
LA011990-0091,74,17,"""We ultimately must respect the jury's decision,"" Rubin said, ""even though I personally disagree with it ."
LA011990-0091,75,13,"""The system worked well for them,"" she said in reference to the Buckeys."
LA011990-0091,76,3,"""They were lucky."
LA011990-0091,77,18,"I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray Buckey molesting children"" ."
LA011990-0091,78,4,Los Angeles County Dist.
LA011990-0091,79,23,"Atty. Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial, and said he backs two state court-reform initiatives ."
LA011990-0091,80,12,"""Too much time and too much money has gone into this case."
LA011990-0091,81,3,This is insane.
LA011990-0091,82,22,The very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational result is preposterous.
LA011990-0091,83,12,"The McMartin case is the very worst example that we have, period."
LA011990-0091,84,7,"But it does not stand alone"" ."
LA011990-0091,85,13,Defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis were beaming after the verdict announcement.
LA011990-0091,86,35,"""I feel great,"" Gits said, indicating he had found hope that the decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count ."
LA011990-0091,87,34,"With the acquittal, Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail."
LA011990-0091,88,19,Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail .
LA011990-0091,89,51,"The McMartin case -- which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography sessions, ""naked games,"" field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, animal mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in the fall of 1983 ."
LA011990-0091,90,19,"The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her son had been sodomized by ""Mr."
LA011990-0091,91,12,"Ray,"" and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused ."
LA011990-0091,92,44,"Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of ""uncharged suspects,"" and eight other South Bay nursery schools ."
LA011990-0091,93,29,"The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept through the affluent beach town."
LA011990-0091,94,30,"Many parents took their youngsters to Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and treatment center, for evaluation; the majority were told that their children had been victimized ."
LA011990-0091,95,33,"In March, 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson."
LA011990-0091,96,29,A county grand jury had indicted them on 115 counts; that indictment was superseded in May by a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children .
LA011990-0091,97,12,"The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning."
LA011990-0091,98,21,"Then-Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught wind of the investigation, were pressing for action ."
LA011990-0091,99,55,"Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had been molested ."
LA011990-0091,100,2,Hysteria grew.
LA011990-0091,101,47,"Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted ""Ray Must Die"" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains ."
LA011990-0091,102,43,"The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb, and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that lasted in one instance for 16 days ."
LA011990-0091,103,24,Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters.
LA011990-0091,104,18,"They munched cookies, swigged root beer, and sometimes sobbed as they told of their experiences at McMartin ."
LA011990-0091,105,35,"Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier ."
LA011990-0091,106,28,"In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, telling each, ""The court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are guilty""."
LA011990-0091,107,18,The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled child witnesses came forward to testify.
LA011990-0091,108,21,"One child was allowed to testify by closed-circuit television, under a new state law passed especially for the McMartin case ."
LA011990-0091,109,44,"But a week later, in January, 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, who had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of the seven defendants, citing ""incredibly weak evidence"" and deciding to proceed only against Ray Buckey and his mother ."
LA011990-0091,110,10,"The trial itself began with jury selection in April, 1987."
LA011990-0091,111,4,Testimony began in July.
LA011990-0091,112,19,The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided not to allow their children to testify.
LA011990-0091,113,21,"Eventually nine of 11 named victims took the witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, but for minor inconsistencies ."
LA011990-0091,114,29,"Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of the Buckeys."
LA011990-0091,115,7,Their testimony was often raw and unsettling.
LA011990-0091,116,13,The children's allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians .
LA011990-0091,117,15,But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained their innocence.
LA011990-0091,118,21,"And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their knowledge ."
LA011990-0091,119,39,"The prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused sexually, but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or misinterpreted ."
LA011990-0091,120,27,"The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school, but that the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had happened to them."
LA011990-0091,121,19,It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated .
LA011990-0091,122,24,"The 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting the judge to comment that it had ""poisoned"" everyone it had touched."
LA011990-0091,123,11,"Day after day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre:"
LA011990-0091,124,26,"* Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts as, ""This awful court."
LA011990-0091,125,3,These awful people.
LA011990-0091,126,4,"These awful lies"" ."
LA011990-0091,127,54,"* Therapist Kee MacFarlane, who conducted many of the interviews in which children first disclosed that they had been molested, came under fire when it was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke the story ."
LA011990-0091,128,34,"* Former prosecutor Glenn Stevens became a key defense witness after leaking information that he believed that the defendants were innocent, and signed a movie contract to tell his revised version of events ."
LA011990-0091,129,51,"* A 10-year-old boy, testifying at the preliminary hearing, identified everyone from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his molesters, and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery where they dug up corpses with shovels and pick-axes ."

LA011990-0091,135,43,"An intellectual who often uses expressions derived from his Air Force experience building nuclear missiles, Pounders' strengths are meticulous organization and an extensive knowledge of the law, which he augments with a 3-by-5 index card file system, as well as a new computer."

LA012090-0110,8,39,"Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals, a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades, legal experts say ."
LA012090-0110,9,8,A confusing array of civil actions await resolution.
LA012090-0110,10,43,These include a federal civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers and others; a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers .
LA012090-0110,11,19,"Also, Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother, said his attorney, Scott Bernstein."
LA012090-0110,12,27,And an attorney representing several parents of McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children .
LA012090-0110,13,21,"""I'm convinced this case will never end,"" Eli Gauna, who represents Babette Spitler, a former teacher at the school, said wearily."
LA012090-0110,14,18,"""It will always be there, until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies"" ."
LA012090-0110,15,45,"In the criminal case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history -- Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted Thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who attended the family nursery school in Manhattan Beach."
LA012090-0110,16,15,"The jury deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations."
LA012090-0110,17,17,A decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against Ray Buckey .
LA012090-0110,18,18,"The verdict was a high mark, but not the final moment, in a lengthy and entangled legal saga."
LA012090-0110,19,23,"The criminal case began in March, 1984, when seven McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of molestation."
LA012090-0110,20,16,The indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of 208 counts of molestation and conspiracy .
LA012090-0110,21,12,"After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial."
LA012090-0110,22,28,"Defendants included Buckey; his mother; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who was the school founder; his sister Peggy Ann Buckey; and teachers Spitler, Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson."
LA012090-0110,23,8,"But a week after the hearing ended, Dist."
LA012090-0110,24,15,"Atty. Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing ""incredibly weak evidence"" ."
LA012090-0110,25,15,"Even before the criminal case went to trial, civil litigation already was in the works."
LA012090-0110,26,32,"In 1984, a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills, cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations."
LA012090-0110,27,22,But those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case .
LA012090-0110,28,27,"Greg Mooney, an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs, explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing, defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims."
LA012090-0110,29,33,Defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue .
LA012090-0110,30,19,"""The civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the criminal case,"" Mooney said ."
LA012090-0110,31,12,"He said Friday, however, that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled."
LA012090-0110,32,25,Mooney said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide what to do with the 13 remaining criminal counts .
LA012090-0110,33,13,"""It's impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue,"" Mooney said."
LA012090-0110,34,8,"""Somewhere between a handful and a bushelful"" ."
LA012090-0110,35,14,Any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children.
LA012090-0110,36,29,"The parents could not seek damages on their own, because the one-year statute of limitations -- the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed -- has passed ."
LA012090-0110,37,16,"Under state law, children who allege abuse have until they are 19 years old to file."
LA012090-0110,38,29,"Many of the children who attended McMartin are now entering their early teens, but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years old ."
LA012090-0110,39,20,"Legal experts, however, say some courts have held that child abuse victims can file at any time in their life."
LA012090-0110,40,33,"In the so-called delayed-discovery theory, a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation, and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years ."
LA012090-0110,41,30,"""It's a possibility that hangs over the former defendants,"" said attorney Gauna, noting a recent landmark California court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims ."
LA012090-0110,42,21,"Mooney said he knows of families that, seeking legal advantage, waited for the criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action."
LA012090-0110,43,42,"He explained that some families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than in a criminal case: the burden of proof in civil litigation is the preponderance of the evidence, not reasonable doubt, as in a criminal trial."
LA012090-0110,44,16,"Also, in a civil case, only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict."
LA012090-0110,45,6,Criminal convictions require unanimous juries .
LA012090-0110,46,18,Whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings is yet to be seen.
LA012090-0110,47,21,And some families question whether the McMartin defendants' insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school .
LA012090-0110,48,6,"""There hasn't been any decisions yet."
LA012090-0110,49,20,"The parents need a little space between the events of this week and deciding what they will do,"" Mooney said."
LA012090-0110,50,12,"""There is some sentiment that says, 'Let's just put this behind us'."
LA012090-0110,51,23,But there is also sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the criminal case left off .
LA012090-0110,52,15,"""They heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the children."
LA012090-0110,53,23,"They think maybe since the criminal jury couldn't get the higher standard of proof, a civil jury would bring about a resolution"" ."
LA012090-0110,54,28,"Said one McMartin attendee's parent, who asked not to be identified: ""I might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child."
LA012090-0110,55,10,"But there apparently isn't any money there to be had""."
LA012090-0110,56,35,"The only other reasons for filing such a suit, the parent added, would be ""to work through a lot of emotional things, and we have already done that by participating in the criminal proceedings"" ."
LA012090-0110,57,23,"Gauna, Spitler's attorney, said the litigation will go on because ""maybe a half-dozen to a dozen hard-line parents won't let it go away."
LA012090-0110,58,11,"They will live this case until the day they die"" ."
LA012090-0110,59,15,"Meanwhile, already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the early defendants."
LA012090-0110,60,23,"Peggy Ann Buckey, Virginia McMartin, Spitler and Raidor are suing the television station, the reporter who broke the McMartin story and others ."
LA012090-0110,61,17,"The suit alleges that the station and reporter, Wayne Satz, were ""creating rather than reporting the news""."
LA012090-0110,62,37,"A lower court held that the station, KABC, was protected from the action on constitutional grounds, but a state appellate court ruled the case should proceed to trial, and the state Supreme Court upheld that decision ."
LA012090-0110,63,26,"The case, now in the early pretrial stages, is being watched closely, because it could set precedent in the field of press law, experts said ."
LA012090-0110,64,14,Another suit pits former McMartin defendants and the pre-school against their liability insurance carriers.
LA012090-0110,65,20,The McMartin side alleges that the insurance carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills .
LA012090-0110,66,21,"While the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs, they contend the defendants should have used only one attorney."
LA012090-0110,67,17,"However, the defendants are arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest, each needed their own counsel."
LA012090-0110,68,14,"One of the former defendants, preschool teacher Maryann Jackson, settled out of court ."
LA012090-0110,69,40,"As it becomes apparent that McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave behind."
LA012090-0110,70,15,"Soon, some of the children will be able to make their own legal decisions ."
LA012090-0110,71,11,"Noted one parent: ""It's really not our decision as parents anymore."
LA012090-0110,72,7,"These children will soon be adults"" ."

LA012190-0194,10,9,Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV.
LA012190-0194,11,13,"Abby Mann watched, listened -- and saw the makings of a movie ."
LA012190-0194,12,21,"Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case."
LA012190-0194,13,31,"In that 1986 interview, Peggy Buckey was ""quite eloquent"" in arguing that charges against her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, Mann recalled Friday ."
LA012190-0194,14,21,"Mann, an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer, recognized a theme he had tapped before: the hysteria of a witch hunt."
LA012190-0194,15,22,"Soon, Mann became a controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie and book deals."
LA012190-0194,16,30,"And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy, at least, from his point of view ."
LA012190-0194,17,42,"But Mann and his wife, Myra, who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay, aren't expected to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case -- or the perspective ."
LA012190-0194,18,24,"At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project."
LA012190-0194,19,17,"That producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well ."
LA012190-0194,20,8,"""It's definitely a TV thing,"" one agent said."
LA012190-0194,21,14,"""Just one of those perfect, high-concept, lurid television M-O-Ws"" -- an acronym for movies-of-the-week."
LA012190-0194,22,17,"""The producer chases down participants, gets rights -- and then it's an easy sale to networks"" ."
LA012190-0194,23,7,"Not that easy, network executives say ."
LA012190-0194,24,37,"Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment -- the Stuart murder case in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems."
LA012190-0194,25,17,The jury's deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a victim?
LA012190-0194,26,28,"""None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story,"" predicted Steven White, an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC and ABC."
LA012190-0194,27,9,"""First, the man is still accused of 13 crimes."
LA012190-0194,28,21,". . . If I were sitting in my old job, I wouldn't touch this thing with a 10-foot pole"" ."
LA012190-0194,29,33,"""It raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to be looked at with a microscope,"" said Larry Strichman, a senior executive in movie development at CBS ."
LA012190-0194,30,8,"""What is the story you want to tell?"
LA012190-0194,31,10,Is it a story of justice done or justice denied?
LA012190-0194,32,14,And it's real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question is.
LA012190-0194,33,14,"Unlike a documentary, it's hard to take an ambiguous position in a docudrama"" ."
LA012190-0194,34,8,"Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however."
LA012190-0194,35,21,One pointed out that the Billionaire Boys Club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials regarding the slayings were over .
LA012190-0194,36,8,"""There are no rules,"" the producer said ."
LA012190-0194,37,10,Hollywood's role in the McMartin case came to prominence early.
LA012190-0194,38,18,"Not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers pitched projects to networks."
LA012190-0194,39,15,"Though no explicit McMartin story was produced, child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject."
LA012190-0194,40,22,"One CBS fictional movie last year -- ""Did You Know the Muffin Man""? -- featured a preschool and satanic child molesters ."
LA012190-0194,41,44,"Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" in 1961, won an Emmy for ""The Marcus-Nelson Murders,"" a three-hour ""Kojak"" drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted of the killings of two white women."
LA012190-0194,42,14,"The prosecutors, the media and the community seemed blinded by hysteria, Mann said ."
LA012190-0194,43,17,"Gaining the confidence of the McMartin defendants, the Manns were ultimately hired as ""investigators"" by the defense."
LA012190-0194,44,29,That and their earlier alliance with former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain .
LA012190-0194,45,50,"Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over."
LA012190-0194,46,18,"But in late 1986, Mann released interviews with Stevens in which Stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt."
LA012190-0194,47,18,Mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an obstruction of justice .
LA012190-0194,48,19,"Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict, which would improve the value of Mann's movie deal."
LA012190-0194,49,20,But Stevens and the Manns have said their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out .
LA012190-0194,50,9,At least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores.
LA012190-0194,51,32,"Ray Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a variety of publishers ."
LA012190-0194,52,22,"Times staff writer Lois Timnick, who covered the case from its early stages through the trial, also is planning a book ."
LA012190-0194,53,9,Mann said his script isn't a courtroom drama .

LA012290-0036,9,41,"A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the ""extreme stress"" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement ."
LA012290-0036,10,62,"The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that, ""after much prayer and consultation,"" he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims ."
LA012290-0036,11,42,"The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school."
LA012290-0036,12,8,The jurors deadlocked on 13 other counts .
LA012290-0036,13,17,"Nonetheless, the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities where it was centered ."
LA012290-0036,14,28,St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged .
LA012290-0036,15,42,"But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of St. Cross ."
LA012290-0036,16,23,"When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church."
LA012290-0036,17,29,"Though investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no trace of blood, attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run preschool, which closed soon afterward ."
LA012290-0036,18,30,"The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to support the children's claims ."
LA012290-0036,19,30,"Periodically over the years, Eales said, he would receive threatening phone calls at the church and rectory, and the harassment increased as the McMartin case began to wind down ."
LA012290-0036,20,14,"Twice in December, the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten eggs."
LA012290-0036,21,36,"In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the vandals, who identified themselves as ""the Beach Cities' Conscience,"" warned that ""there is simply no place for Satan worship in this town"" ."
LA012290-0036,22,35,"The harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after Christmas of a youth counselor at the church, who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he had met through his work at St. Cross ."
LA012290-0036,23,36,"The counselor, it turned out, was a convicted child molester who had been brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor who was hired after the McMartin case broke."
LA012290-0036,24,25,"Then, just days after that assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned ."
LA012290-0036,25,23,"""It's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps,"" Eales said Sunday ."

AP891017-0195,10,27,"A major earthquake rocked northern California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95 miles away."
AP891017-0195,11,9,"Some buildings may have collapsed, said Police Officer D."
AP891017-0195,12,29,"Collins. There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported."
AP891017-0195,13,24,"The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena."
AP891017-0195,14,12,"The preliminary reading was from the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said."
AP891017-0195,15,21,Televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30-foot section of the span's upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level.
AP891017-0195,16,12,Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15 seconds.
AP891017-0195,17,24,Players from the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave their seats.
AP891017-0195,18,7,Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.
AP891017-0195,19,25,"The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the northeast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the east."
AP891017-0195,20,17,"The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at The Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco."
AP891017-0195,21,13,The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
AP891017-0195,22,11,Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
AP891017-0195,23,15,Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
AP891017-0195,24,25,"An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage."
AP891017-0195,25,21,"A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage."
AP891017-0195,26,24,"The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale ."
AP891017-0199,13,37,"A violent earthquake rocked Northern California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in Candlestick Park and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away."
AP891017-0199,14,10,CBS-TV reported one person had been killed on the bridge.
AP891017-0199,15,32,"There were no other immediate confirmed reports of deaths or injuries, but ABC-TV and CNN both said some people were injured at Candlestick, where the game was canceled and fans were evacuated."
AP891017-0199,16,26,"It was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from the quake, which struck at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale."

AP891017-0204,10,29,The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
AP891017-0204,11,6,A 1988 report by the U.S.
AP891017-0204,12,28,Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
AP891017-0204,13,38,"The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena."
AP891017-0204,14,9,``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.
AP891017-0204,15,16,"It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said."
AP891017-0204,16,28,"He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,'' presented information that was already widely known among scientists."
AP891017-0204,17,12,Allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps.

AP891017-0204,25,15,``It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event.
AP891017-0204,26,10,"It's something we should therefore be ready for,'' Allen said."
AP891017-0204,27,33,"The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said."
AP891017-0204,28,17,"``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake,'' he said."
AP891017-0204,29,12,``What will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved''.
AP891017-0204,30,26,Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.
AP891017-0204,31,22,"In addition, some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the Bay Bridge."
AP891017-0204,32,16,"In some areas of Southern California, there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring."
AP891017-0204,33,30,"The highest, the USGS says, is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018 ."
AP891018-0084,9,28,"Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault."
AP891018-0084,10,37,"But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area."
AP891018-0084,11,43,A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.
AP891018-0084,12,23,"The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S."
AP891018-0084,13,20,"Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment."
AP891018-0084,14,20,The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
AP891018-0084,15,29,"The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday."
AP891018-0084,16,35,"These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least 2,500 people."
AP891018-0084,17,23,"The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again."
AP891018-0084,18,22,Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists believed.
AP891018-0084,19,17,That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.
AP891018-0084,20,2,Others disagreed.
AP891018-0084,21,21,"Faced with conflicting estimates, the Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said represented a consensus on the debate."
AP891018-0084,22,19,The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years.
AP891018-0084,23,22,It said the southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of generating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.
AP891018-0084,24,13,Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles of the fault segment.
AP891018-0084,25,13,"``Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one,'' Heaton said."
AP891018-0084,26,16,``There was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake''.
AP891018-0084,27,20,"The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated."
AP891018-0084,28,27,"Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast doubt on this assumption."
AP891018-0084,29,38,"Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area."
AP891018-0084,30,18,"As bad as Tuesday's quake was, ``it was not a 1906 earthquake,'' Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said."
AP891018-0084,31,10,``The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming.
AP891018-0084,32,7,"The question is when,'' Peck said ."
AP891019-0037,8,35,"Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters."

LA101889-0066,9,41,"The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989."
LA101889-0066,10,9,A 6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865 .

LA101889-0066,12,33,"Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018 ."
LA101889-0066,13,60,"The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake ."
LA101889-0066,14,42,"A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much ."
LA101889-0066,15,32,"Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as ""preshocks"" of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor."
LA101889-0066,16,20,"He said ""foreshocks"" would not be the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck ."
LA101889-0066,17,9,Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely.
LA101889-0066,18,27,"But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months."
LA101889-0066,19,18,A 5.9 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area .
LA101889-0066,20,22,"After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S."
LA101889-0066,21,24,"Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, within the next few days in the vicinity ."
LA101889-0066,22,22,"But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity."
LA101889-0066,23,26,"The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault."
LA101889-0066,24,20,Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area .
LA101889-0066,25,22,"The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea."
LA101889-0066,26,18,It has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded history .
LA101889-0066,27,60,"Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a ""strong"" shock, not a ""major"" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a ""great"" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be ."
LA101889-0066,28,34,Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades .
LA101889-0066,29,28,"But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake."
LA101889-0066,30,15,Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the power of an earthquake .
LA101889-0066,31,27,"Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another."
LA101889-0066,32,30,But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological Survey's Menlo Park office .
LA101889-0066,33,39,"Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter ."
LA101889-0066,34,34,"Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake ."
LA101889-0066,35,55,"The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point ."
LA101889-0066,36,25,"Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas."
LA101889-0066,37,24,"But when a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case ."
LA101889-0066,38,19,"Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger near the Bay Area."
LA101889-0066,39,30,"But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have been a number of quakes ."
LA101889-0066,40,19,"In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area."
LA101889-0066,41,19,They noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906 .
LA101889-0066,42,45,"Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct. 16 ."

LA101889-0108,13,16,Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated .
LA101889-0108,14,20,And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget .
LA101889-0108,15,18,"I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit."
LA101889-0108,16,11,It was shortly after the network went on the air .
LA101889-0108,17,20,"My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening ."
LA101889-0108,18,23,"To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time ."
LA101889-0108,19,10,I opened the door to the trailer and looked out.
LA101889-0108,20,34,The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
LA101889-0108,21,17,It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete .
LA101889-0108,22,26,"A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long ."
LA101889-0108,23,8,I walked into the stadium to interview fans.
LA101889-0108,24,7,"And again, I sensed little panic ."
LA101889-0108,25,16,"Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed ."
LA101889-0108,26,16,"And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked to varied."
LA101889-0108,27,18,Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more shaken than those in the lower levels.

LA102089-0172,19,11,Some buckled and pitched forward off their foundations into the street.
LA102089-0172,20,13,Others appeared outwardly sound but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable .
LA102089-0172,21,29,"Why did some of the luxury, four-story apartment buildings collapse at the Marina while in nearby Chinatown, shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained little damage in the 6.9 temblor?"
LA102089-0172,22,28,"Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart, killing five pedestrians below?"
LA102089-0172,23,38,"""The buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design,"" said Peter I. Yanev, chairman of EQE Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco ."
LA102089-0172,24,35,"""They were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city,"" explained Yanev, who said he has traveled to ""all the major earthquakes"" in the last 20 years studying their impact on construction ."
LA102089-0172,25,29,"The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 years ago ."
LA102089-0172,26,25,Yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early part of this century when there were no earthquake codes .
LA102089-0172,27,23,"""What collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom (floor),"" Yanev said."
LA102089-0172,28,11,"""So, you have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments."
LA102089-0172,29,11,You effectively have no walls on one side of the building.
LA102089-0172,30,13,"The connections just break, and the front end falls into the street"" ."

LA102089-0172,32,26,"""Should we have an earthquake centered off the Golden Gate Bridge instead of Santa Cruz, you'd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse,"" he said ."
LA102089-0172,33,18,Experts said they did not anticipate that the Marina District would be the major problem in an earthquake.
LA102089-0172,34,16,"The worst areas, they believed, would be Chinatown and the Tenderloin, where brick buildings abound ."
LA102089-0172,35,29,"Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located ""up in the hills"" atop ""very firm soil,"" and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away ."
LA102089-0172,36,17,"In the city's high-rise office towers, a few broken windows and other cosmetic damage could be seen."
LA102089-0172,37,12,A preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers rendered unsafe by the quake.
LA102089-0172,38,12,"But most buildings, including the landmark Transamerica Pyramid, were not touched ."
LA102089-0172,39,25,"Jay Cahill, an owner of Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built several high-rises in the city, said the earthquake codes ""did their job"" ."
LA102089-0172,40,22,"""What this quake proves is that the engineers were right"" when they said tall buildings could withstand a strong quake, he said."
LA102089-0172,41,23,They said the downtown buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least 8 magnitude with an epicenter in San Francisco .
LA102089-0172,42,19,Earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed .
LA102089-0172,43,38,"""An earthquake means that the ground shakes, and that means force is applied to the sides of buildings,"" said George C. Lee, acting director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo ."
LA102089-0172,44,27,"When architects design skyscrapers, Lee said, they factor in wind gusts and earth movement -- forces that are not considered as much when constructing smaller buildings ."
LA102089-0172,45,26,"In smaller buildings, he said, contractors usually make sure that vertical forces -- such as snow and ice -- cannot force a structure to collapse ."
LA102089-0172,46,38,"Throughout the Bay Area, residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others, much like San Francisco was left to wonder why the Marina District was hard hit and others spared ."
LA102089-0172,47,26,"In Santa Cruz, initial damages were estimated at $350 million, and 30% of the downtown mall -- the heart of the city -- was severely damaged."

LA102389-0075,11,24,"Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time."
LA102389-0075,12,21,"They are the scenes of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake ."
LA102389-0075,13,51,There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth .
LA102389-0075,14,39,"""From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most,"" Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit."
LA102389-0075,15,22,"""We know it means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the loss of life"" ."
LA102389-0075,16,3,Charleston had warning.
LA102389-0075,17,4,San Francisco did not.
LA102389-0075,18,27,"Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee."
LA102389-0075,19,26,"Still, at least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo, while at least 60 deaths have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake ."
LA102389-0075,20,31,"Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage."
LA102389-0075,21,18,"Five days after the storm, many city residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe drinking water."
LA102389-0075,22,4,Street lights didn't work.
LA102389-0075,23,16,Broken glass and other debris left the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires .
LA102389-0075,24,17,By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of the earthquake.
LA102389-0075,25,5,Electricity was largely restored overnight.
LA102389-0075,26,9,And most broken natural gas lines were quickly repaired.
LA102389-0075,27,13,"Restaurants in Chinatown, North Beach and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night."

LA102389-0075,30,11,"""We were gridlocked for two days because of the debris"" ."
LA102389-0075,31,30,"And a week after the hurricane, Charleston -- which like San Francisco has a tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs."
LA102389-0075,32,27,It was more than 10 days before restaurants and other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin to return .

LA102389-0075,34,21,"By Sunday, tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors."
LA102389-0075,35,9,Tourism is a $2.5-billion-a-year business in San Francisco .
LA102389-0075,36,19,It took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on their feet in Charleston.
LA102389-0075,37,25,It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest industries .
LA102389-0075,38,18,"Citywide, Charleston had 68 buildings collapse, compared to 60 buildings destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District ."
LA102389-0075,39,10,In Charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed.
LA102389-0075,40,3,It was visible.
LA102389-0075,41,11,In San Francisco much of the damage may still be undetected.
LA102389-0075,42,17,Water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months.

LA102389-0075,52,7,Hugo left Charleston isolated from the world.
LA102389-0075,53,26,Communications broke down soon after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before the nation began to learn of the widespread damage.
LA102389-0075,54,8,Even local residents were left without any information.
LA102389-0075,55,30,"The hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings ."
LA102389-0075,56,23,"Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake struck, and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster."
LA102389-0075,57,16,San Francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered radios and TVs .
LA102389-0075,58,22,"Damage estimates from Hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion, while earthquake damage estimates Sunday reached the $6.6 billion mark ."
LA102389-0075,59,34,"Besides that black page in the ledger of history, both San Francisco and Charleston also have another experience in common: Both have experienced frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government ."
LA102389-0075,60,36,"Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of America's worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern California ."
LA102389-0075,61,14,"""There's nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them,"" he said."

FT923-5589,6,47,"WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets."
FT923-5589,7,39,"On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points."
FT923-5589,8,46,"The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40."
FT923-5589,9,8,This was its lowest-ever point against the D-mark.
FT923-5589,10,17,The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time.
FT923-5589,11,23,"Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbank tightened, their respective monetary policies."
FT923-5589,12,25,The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar.
FT923-5589,13,30,"So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent."
FT923-5589,14,38,"Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down."
FT923-5589,15,30,"While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling."
FT923-5589,16,14,There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall.
FT923-5589,17,16,"The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds to inflationary pressures."
FT923-5589,18,39,"The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency."
FT923-5589,19,45,"The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower."
FT923-5589,20,6,The second explanation carries more weight.
FT923-5589,21,43,"Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again."
FT923-5589,22,25,The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.

FT923-5589,24,36,"Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy, looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent."

FT923-5589,28,27,"But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims."
FT923-5589,29,29,The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.

AP890107-0016,8,37,TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II.
AP890107-0016,9,31,"Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology."
AP890107-0016,10,15,He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
AP890107-0016,11,21,"But in his first 20 years, the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu."
AP890107-0016,12,48,"The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of 25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign ``Showa'' _ ``enlightened peace''."
AP890107-0016,13,24,The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s.
AP890107-0016,14,18,"But it was his first effective decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific conflict."
AP890107-0016,15,48,"On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace."
AP890107-0016,16,13,"Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on until annihilation?"
AP890107-0016,17,28,"Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular leader, offered his opinion for the first time."
AP890107-0016,18,24,"He spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of families who lost everything in air raids."
AP890107-0016,19,13,"``I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he said."
AP890107-0016,20,25,``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened''.
AP890107-0016,21,41,"Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji, whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers: ``The time has come when we must bear the unbearable''."
AP890107-0016,22,11,"In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break with tradition."
AP890107-0016,23,26,In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 _ the first time ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally announced the decision to surrender.
AP890107-0016,24,16,He told the ravaged nation that ``the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage''.
AP890107-0016,25,23,"Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A."

AP890107-0016,29,14,"On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperor publicly renounced his divinity."
AP890107-0016,30,33,"It was a choice that enabled Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had demanded."
AP890107-0016,31,29,"It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a ``living god''."
AP890107-0016,32,16,The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that of a kind uncle.
AP890107-0016,33,9,He became a widely respected authority on marine biology.
AP890107-0016,34,26,"He possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty."
AP890107-0016,35,15,"In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular comic book series."
AP890107-0016,36,10,"Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to Japan."
AP890107-0016,37,34,"A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should be abolished."
AP890107-0016,38,9,Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
AP890107-0016,39,13,"From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the people to rebuild."
AP890107-0016,40,40,"The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives."
AP890107-0016,41,17,"Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency."

LA012289-0055,10,28,"At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because ""it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors"" ."
LA012289-0055,11,46,"I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries ."
LA012289-0055,12,18,"Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for."
LA012289-0055,13,25,"I often wonder if Hirohito ever felt grateful to those generals who were sacrificed, in part, so that he could live for another 43 years."

LA013090-0161,10,31,"CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout ."
LA013090-0161,11,43,"On the upside for CBS -- Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to the debut of the new series, ""Grand Slam,"" to provide a good audience sampling and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night ."
LA013090-0161,12,25,"It was CBS' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided, which resulted in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969 ."

LA020890-0197,10,35,"The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday ."
LA020890-0197,11,34,"The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items ."
LA020890-0197,12,13,"Competing against the Rose Bowl are San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix ."
LA020890-0197,13,15,"Because the Rose Bowl has 102,083 seats, the council selected it as the prime venue."
LA020890-0197,14,33,"Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadena's deputy city manager."
LA020890-0197,15,27,"""The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim,"" Aghjayan said ."
LA020890-0197,16,8,Details of the split are still being negotiated.
LA020890-0197,17,21,"One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25% ."
LA020890-0197,18,34,"Pasadena earned $300,000 from the 1983 Super Bowl and $800,000 in 1987, the money coming from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission taxes, charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees."
LA020890-0197,19,23,"In addition, the city was allowed to buy 1,200 tickets at face value for local distribution by directors and other city officials ."
LA020890-0197,20,30,"But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the city's Board of Directors."
LA020890-0197,21,22,"In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in exchange for the benefits to local economies, he said ."
LA020890-0197,22,25,"Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL."
LA020890-0197,23,19,"It also would provide 350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent compound ."
LA020890-0197,24,29,"The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes, $75,000 in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about $55,000 in parking fees ."
LA020890-0197,25,7,The board has approved the proposal .
LA020890-0197,26,35,"The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8.3-million project to renovate the press box and restructure about 1,000 seats for club seating, with an adjacent lounge, restaurant, hall of fame museum and gift shop ."

SJMN91-06025282,10,28,Things are different; He says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's greatest sports events.
SJMN91-06025282,11,10,"""The Super Bowl is about money,"" Carley said last week."
SJMN91-06025282,12,15,"""And last time we were basically onlookers.""; Things are a lot different this time around."
SJMN91-06025282,13,30,"This year, Carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats."
SJMN91-06025282,14,16,"The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer."
SJMN91-06025282,15,16,Other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a Doug Williams golf tournament.
SJMN91-06025282,16,31,"'Much more involvement'; This year, the Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee."
SJMN91-06025282,17,19,"But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the NFL for the game."
SJMN91-06025282,18,20,"""There's much more involvement this time, black and white,"" said Carley, who is the affirmative-action officer for Hillsboro Community College."
SJMN91-06025282,19,5,"""There's been a heightened awareness."
SJMN91-06025282,20,42,"In 1984, there was not even a thought given to a black man.""; About 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers and shakers, were expected to arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game Sunday."
SJMN91-06025282,21,34,"The game itself, which is televised to 750 million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention."
SJMN91-06025282,22,21,"Hotels, restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million."
SJMN91-06025282,23,27,"'It's a bay window'; ""The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way,"" said Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force."
SJMN91-06025282,24,29,"""You don't have to say Tampa, Fla., anymore.""; The Super Bowl also can highlight a community's problems, and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface."
SJMN91-06025282,25,18,"""It's more than a window into a town,"" said Jim Steeg, director of special events for the NFL."
SJMN91-06025282,26,40,"""It's a bay window.""; Last month, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King."
SJMN91-06025282,27,44,"A week before the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars."
SJMN91-06025282,28,31,"While the disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the NFL was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities."
SJMN91-06025282,29,13,"""I think Miami was the awakening for a lot of people,"" Carley said."
SJMN91-06025282,30,44,"In Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years: the Gasparilla Parade, an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates."
SJMN91-06025282,31,16,Tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the NFL for the Super Bowl.
SJMN91-06025282,32,34,"But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white, all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla."
SJMN91-06025282,33,21,"The club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents, including Carley, that the club be integrated immediately."
SJMN91-06025282,34,5,"Instead, they canceled the parade."
SJMN91-06025282,35,22,"The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort."
SJMN91-06025282,36,15,"SUPER BOWL XXVI; Super Bowl XXVI will be played Jan. 26, 1992, in the Metrodome."
SJMN91-06025282,37,10,It will be Minneapolis' first time as the host city.

WSJ870122-0100,7,19,"Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash."
WSJ870122-0100,8,32,"Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel."
WSJ870122-0100,9,23,"The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl."
WSJ870122-0100,10,28,And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
WSJ870122-0100,11,46,"Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs."
WSJ870122-0100,12,31,One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
WSJ870122-0100,13,28,"If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60."
WSJ870122-0100,14,34,"Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc."
WSJ870122-0100,15,19,"To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says."
WSJ870122-0100,16,26,"And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient."
WSJ870122-0100,17,16,"The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each."
WSJ870122-0100,18,35,"""Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos."
WSJ870122-0100,19,13,Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game.
WSJ870122-0100,20,13,"""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" says Mr. Foley."
WSJ870122-0100,21,17,Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules.
WSJ870122-0100,22,31,"A spokesman for Adolph Coors & Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business""."
WSJ870122-0100,23,22,"Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game."
WSJ870122-0100,24,11,Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed.
WSJ870122-0100,25,23,"Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest."
WSJ870122-0100,26,21,"Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a ""banquet meeting exception""."
WSJ870122-0100,27,21,"Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker."
WSJ870122-0100,28,38,"Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst & Whinney."
WSJ870122-0100,29,24,"If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says."

AP900421-0075,16,25,"You can cut it with a knife, incredible,'' said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore."
AP900421-0075,17,29,"Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date."
AP900421-0075,18,14,As Chaisson remarked last week: ``The universe has been around for 15 billion years.
AP900421-0075,19,9,A couple of weeks is not going to matter''.
AP900421-0075,20,7,``The heavens look the same to me.
AP900421-0075,21,7,"The secrets are the same,'' Chaisson said."
AP900421-0075,22,14,"``There's not a bit of difference,'' agreed Charles Pellerin Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics."
AP900421-0075,23,15,``I think the main point is the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition''.
AP900421-0075,24,21,"The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay awaiting the Tuesday launch."
AP900421-0075,25,22,"If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay."
AP900421-0075,26,28,NASA said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that same day.
AP900421-0075,27,29,"After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two."
AP900421-0075,28,17,The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
AP900421-0075,29,22,It also is considered by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date; it will be the 35th.
AP900421-0075,30,21,"The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is expanding."
AP900421-0075,31,20,His work gave rise to the theory the universe was created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
AP900421-0075,32,30,"From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory."
AP900421-0075,33,17,"Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes."
AP900421-0075,34,40,"By studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and life forms _ exist."
AP900421-0075,35,13,"``If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,'' Chaisson said."
AP900421-0075,36,24,NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed.
AP900421-0075,37,23,"The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one, the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad."
AP900421-0075,38,22,"The procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last week to advance the launch to Tuesday, a day earlier than planned."
AP900421-0075,39,15,Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were returned to the telescope Friday following 130 hours of recharging.
AP900421-0075,40,33,"The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed 380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone."
AP900421-0075,41,24,"Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission."
AP900421-0075,42,19,The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
AP900421-0075,43,18,"Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan, veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary."
AP900421-0075,44,24,The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
AP900421-0075,45,21,"``You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or gremlins that may sneak up on any given day,'' Sullivan said."
AP900421-0075,46,12,``But those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't encounter''.
AP900421-0075,47,29,"In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500 million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument."
AP900421-0075,48,24,The European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time .
AP900424-0048,11,32,Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
AP900424-0048,12,25,"``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities."
AP900424-0048,13,27,Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
AP900424-0048,14,22,More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
AP900424-0048,15,22,"The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center."
AP900424-0048,16,30,"The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program."
AP900424-0048,17,7,``It's going to change our perspective altogether.
AP900424-0048,18,19,"I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things''."
AP900424-0048,19,31,"Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere."
AP900424-0048,20,6,It is the 35th shuttle mission.
AP900424-0048,21,39,"Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion."
AP900424-0048,22,20,"Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident."
AP900424-0048,23,24,"The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle."
AP900424-0048,24,25,"The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families."
AP900424-0048,25,22,"The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space."
AP900424-0048,26,14,Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
AP900424-0048,27,26,"Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900424-0048,28,18,Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff.
AP900424-0048,29,23,"However, NASA said it will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ a week after launch."
AP900424-0048,30,26,"In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument."
AP900424-0048,31,14,The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
AP900424-0048,32,17,NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space.
AP900424-0048,33,23,"During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories."
AP900424-0048,34,25,"As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years."
AP900424-0048,35,27,"Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars."
AP900424-0048,36,15,Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
AP900424-0048,37,21,"The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding."
AP900424-0048,38,18,His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
AP900424-0048,39,20,"In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive."
AP900424-0048,40,8,It is the skull's third trip into space.
AP900424-0048,41,18,"The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif ."
AP900424-0081,11,26,Jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted high above Earth to launch ``a great adventure for mankind''.
AP900424-0081,12,34,"Charles Robert O'Dell, a Rice University space physicist who has worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was ``comparable to raising a child."
AP900424-0081,13,10,I've been with the program since it was a concept.
AP900424-0081,14,22,"``There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and five of my friends thrust into orbit,'' he said."
AP900424-0081,15,34,"Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope Science Institute there, called the launch ``the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind."
AP900424-0081,16,4,``It was incredibly beautiful.
AP900424-0081,17,16,"The power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power,'' Norman said."
AP900424-0081,18,12,Discovery's liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended seven years of delays.
AP900424-0081,19,21,The $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
AP900424-0081,20,21,"Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff."
AP900424-0081,21,14,"Only a few dozen of them returned Tuesday, but they were just as excited."
AP900424-0081,22,8,``There were times when we were deeply depressed.
AP900424-0081,23,24,"There were times when we were elated'' about Hubble's progress, said William H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's astrometry project leader."
AP900424-0081,24,2,Jeffreys said.
AP900424-0081,25,12,``This is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief''.
AP900424-0081,26,28,"Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST."
AP900424-0081,27,5,It really gets to you.''
AP900424-0096,10,33,"Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time."
AP900424-0096,11,25,"Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal."
AP900424-0096,12,14,"At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston."
AP900424-0096,13,16,"``As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect,'' said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle."
AP900424-0096,14,17,Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
AP900424-0096,15,32,"Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle."
AP900424-0096,16,23,There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
AP900424-0096,17,5,``Our window on the universe''!
AP900424-0096,18,15,NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
AP900424-0096,19,28,"``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly."
AP900424-0096,20,7,``Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted''.
AP900424-0096,21,19,"The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment."
AP900424-0096,22,26,It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
AP900424-0096,23,18,"While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness."
AP900424-0096,24,22,"In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland."
AP900424-0096,25,36,On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
AP900424-0096,26,22,Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station.
AP900424-0096,27,26,"``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars'''? said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut."
AP900424-0096,28,15,"``It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right''."
AP900424-0096,29,19,"The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car."
AP900424-0096,30,25,"When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side."
AP900424-0096,31,30,"It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling."
AP900424-0096,32,24,That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion _ the Big Bang _ created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
AP900424-0096,33,18,The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
AP900424-0096,34,4,How big is it?
AP900424-0096,35,14,"The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches."
AP900424-0096,36,14,"Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer."
AP900424-0096,37,17,"In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances."
AP900424-0096,38,38,"On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own."
AP900424-0096,39,12,"In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle."
AP900424-0096,40,30,But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun.
AP900424-0096,41,35,"Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually."
AP900424-0096,42,7,Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
AP900424-0096,43,27,"With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process."
AP900424-0096,44,17,"The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late."
AP900424-0096,45,18,The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
AP900424-0096,46,21,"``On the way uphill,'' as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with ``several flecks of things''."
AP900424-0096,47,27,He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit.
AP900424-0096,48,20,"The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative."
AP900424-0096,49,6,Neither problem was considered serious .
AP900425-0013,9,17,Already they're saying it's the biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a telescope.
AP900425-0013,10,12,"So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the universe."
AP900425-0013,11,5,See how big it is.
AP900425-0013,12,3,Learn its age.
AP900425-0013,13,16,Look at light created 14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
AP900425-0013,14,20,"Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago."
AP900425-0013,15,7,See stars born and see them die.
AP900425-0013,16,3,Watch galaxies form.
AP900425-0013,17,10,Follow the flow of gas into the Milky Way's halo.
AP900425-0013,18,37,"Peer deep into the universe, past so many stars in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime to count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200 billion stars."
AP900425-0013,19,35,"For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before."
AP900425-0013,20,22,"The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck, has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light."
AP900425-0013,21,13,"Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is the messenger of creation."
AP900425-0013,22,25,Tracking the trail of light from today to the first moments contains all the information we will ever have about the creation of the universe.
AP900425-0013,23,16,The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to the first echoes of creation.
AP900425-0013,24,12,"This is a world-class event, even if astronomy is not your thing."
AP900425-0013,25,34,"Superlatives? ``In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990''."
AP900425-0013,26,15,"_ Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore."
AP900425-0013,27,2,One more?
AP900425-0013,28,13,"``No one ever made anything that good,'' James Westphal, California Institute of Technology."
AP900425-0013,29,23,"Another? Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that the Hubble telescope ``will literally be the dawn of a new era in astronomy''."
AP900425-0013,30,7,Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance.
AP900425-0013,31,13,"But the HST, named after Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise."
AP900425-0013,32,34,"Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth but that the farther away they are, the faster they move."
AP900425-0013,33,32,The theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
AP900425-0013,34,25,Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible speed and heat.
AP900425-0013,35,10,"Eventually matter cooled and condensed into galaxies, stars and planets."
AP900425-0013,36,34,"There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all on Earth and all subject to a major limitation _ the atmosphere _ which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through."
AP900425-0013,37,20,The problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.
AP900425-0013,38,27,"The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views of Earth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enough for pictures as they whizzed past."
AP900425-0013,39,15,"With the Hubble, says scientist Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want."
AP900425-0013,40,18,The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
AP900425-0013,41,23,"``On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles away,'' says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project."
AP900425-0013,42,14,"``With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000 miles away."
AP900425-0013,43,12,With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from Washington.''
AP900425-0146,13,26,Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
AP900425-0146,14,29,"The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes."
AP900425-0146,15,14,"``Discovery, go for Hubble release,'' Mission Control told the crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT."
AP900425-0146,16,14,The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
AP900425-0146,17,26,The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.
AP900425-0146,18,13,The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
AP900425-0146,19,16,Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.
AP900425-0146,20,10,But there was a third try and it was successful.
AP900425-0146,21,22,"``We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed,'' the telescope control center in Maryland said."
AP900425-0146,22,13,"``So we have good news,'' said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble control center."
AP900425-0146,23,26,"The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their eight-hour charge."
AP900425-0146,24,36,"Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries."
AP900425-0146,25,30,"``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on its own,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said."
AP900425-0146,26,4,``The game has begun.
AP900425-0146,27,4,The race is on.
AP900425-0146,28,4,The clock is ticking''.
AP900425-0146,29,34,Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.
AP900425-0146,30,28,"Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning Earth in the background."
AP900425-0146,31,22,"Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose pointed toward the sun."
AP900425-0146,32,36,"That was to put the telescope's solar arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay."
AP900425-0146,33,15,"Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any previous shuttle."
AP900425-0146,34,16,The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
AP900425-0146,35,36,"``For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley), something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today,'' Shriver said."
AP900425-0146,36,37,"The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this morning as Mission Control played a song called ``Space is Our World,'' written by members of Discovery's training team and a Houston-area group, Private Numbers."
AP900425-0146,37,32,"Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built."
AP900425-0146,38,17,"``Everything has just being going like clockwork,'' said Ron Schlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard."
AP900425-0146,39,5,``Everybody is in excellent spirits''.
AP900425-0146,40,22,"The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space."
AP900425-0146,41,11,It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboard Discovery.
AP900425-0146,42,21,Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
AP900425-0146,43,37,"It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life."
AP900425-0146,44,20,"The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car."
AP900425-0146,45,20,"When it is in orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays."
AP900425-0146,46,44,"It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago ."
AP900425-0198,11,35,"After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds."
AP900425-0198,12,27,Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
AP900425-0198,13,22,"``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said."
AP900425-0198,14,26,"``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later."
AP900425-0198,15,28,"The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned."
AP900425-0198,16,5,The shuttle then backed away.
AP900425-0198,17,22,"``Thank you very much for the ride,'' said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md."
AP900425-0198,18,22,"Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel."
AP900425-0198,19,5,That proved to be unnecessary.
AP900425-0198,20,18,"``Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did,'' Sullivan said."
AP900425-0198,21,15,She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
AP900425-0198,22,27,"The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast."
AP900425-0198,23,16,"It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge."
AP900425-0198,24,9,"Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome."
AP900425-0198,25,20,"It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again."
AP900425-0198,26,10,A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
AP900425-0198,27,9,"``Houston, we see motion,'' Commander Loren J. Shriver reported."
AP900425-0198,28,32,Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
AP900425-0198,29,25,Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries.
AP900425-0198,30,20,"``At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power,'' Carr said."
AP900425-0198,31,4,``The game has begun.
AP900425-0198,32,4,The race is on.
AP900425-0198,33,4,The clock is ticking''.
AP900425-0198,34,19,Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
AP900425-0198,35,28,"Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope."
AP900425-0198,36,16,"Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown."
AP900425-0198,37,16,The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
AP900425-0198,38,8,Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
AP900425-0198,39,31,"``I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today,'' Shriver said of Hawley."
AP900425-0198,40,13,Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space.
AP900425-0198,41,19,"The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back."
AP900425-0198,42,34,The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.
AP900425-0198,43,18,"On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others."
AP900425-0198,44,18,"The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900425-0198,45,12,Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly.
AP900425-0198,46,16,"If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space."
AP900425-0198,47,23,"Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened."
AP900425-0198,48,25,"``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he said."
AP900425-0198,49,15,The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments.
AP900425-0198,50,15,"If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif."
AP900425-0198,51,23,NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday.
AP900425-0198,52,8,Data will follow in a month or two.
AP900425-0198,53,29,"Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years."
AP900425-0198,54,19,"They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago."
AP900425-0198,55,22,"The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding."
AP900425-0198,56,15,He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation .
AP900426-0135,13,34,Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
AP900426-0135,14,23,"Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved."
AP900426-0135,15,24,"``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis."
AP900426-0135,16,36,"Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard."
AP900426-0135,17,27,"In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees."
AP900426-0135,18,23,"The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well."
AP900426-0135,19,12,"Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems."
AP900426-0135,20,14,The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned.
AP900426-0135,21,19,"The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments."
AP900426-0135,22,27,"Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem."
AP900426-0135,23,17,"It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said."
AP900426-0135,24,23,The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.
AP900426-0135,25,13,"``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman."
AP900426-0135,26,14,``It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause''.
AP900426-0135,27,31,"The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk."
AP900426-0135,28,19,"Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite."
AP900426-0135,29,3,"``Good morning, Discovery."
AP900426-0135,30,12,"I guess you're awake after that song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator."
AP900426-0135,31,9,``There are a lot of happy people down here.
AP900426-0135,32,16,We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep''.
AP900426-0135,33,12,"``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver."
AP900426-0135,34,35,"After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble."
AP900426-0135,35,22,"``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday."
AP900426-0135,36,18,"``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done,'' replied Mission Control."
AP900426-0135,37,6,``Galileo is real proud of you''.
AP900426-0135,38,31,Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
AP900426-0135,39,27,"Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands."
AP900426-0135,40,23,"The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight."
AP900426-0135,41,21,"Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900426-0135,42,8,Data will follow in a month or two.
AP900426-0135,43,23,"If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it."
AP900426-0135,44,23,Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.
AP900426-0135,45,25,"``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he said."
AP900426-0135,46,9,Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.
AP900426-0135,47,25,"On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay."
AP900426-0135,48,28,"One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge."
AP900426-0135,49,8,But there was trouble with the second panel.
AP900426-0135,50,21,"It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again."
AP900426-0135,51,11,The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt.
AP900426-0135,52,33,"By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call."
AP900426-0135,53,9,Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
AP900426-0135,54,18,"The 8-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown."
AP900426-0135,55,15,The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
AP900426-0135,56,32,"Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth."
AP900426-0135,57,18,"They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago."
AP900426-0135,58,19,The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
AP900426-0135,59,18,"Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif ."
AP900426-0185,12,18,Ground controllers cheered after re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennas.
AP900426-0185,13,7,An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
AP900426-0185,14,20,"``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md."
AP900426-0185,15,17,Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
AP900426-0185,16,27,"Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge where it was, what its position was,'' said Goddard's Dave Drachlis."
AP900426-0185,17,17,They also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two high-speed dish antennas.
AP900426-0185,18,22,"``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system,'' Drachlis reported."
AP900426-0185,19,14,The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground.
AP900426-0185,20,15,"Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem, Boggess said."
AP900426-0185,21,13,"``This probably won't be the last time we have a problem,'' he said."
AP900426-0185,22,17,"``We'll keep working at it until we have all these things that need to be done, done."
AP900426-0185,23,4,We'll get them right''.
AP900426-0185,24,20,The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS satellites without success.
AP900426-0185,25,17,"Two low-speed antennas were working fine, but Boggess said they would be ``excruciatingly slow'' for sending data."
AP900426-0185,26,10,There had been a communications outage with the telescope earlier.
AP900426-0185,27,11,It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
AP900426-0185,28,32,"In addition, one of four ``rate gyros,'' wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately."
AP900426-0185,29,13,But it was restored later and the stability of the satellite was unaffected.
AP900426-0185,30,27,"The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala."
AP900426-0185,31,38,"``Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work,'' Boggess said."
AP900426-0185,32,18,"``Having done it once, we've got confidence we can do it and that means the mission can proceed''."
AP900426-0185,33,25,"Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning."
AP900426-0185,34,31,"Its five astronauts spent the day doing experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever flown."
AP900426-0185,35,22,"When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened, starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror for the first time."
AP900426-0185,36,27,"If signals fail to activate the 10-foot-wide aluminum aperture door, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will go into open space and crank it open Saturday."
AP900426-0185,37,13,"The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif."
AP900426-0185,38,13,The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
AP900426-0185,39,23,"On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900426-0185,40,9,Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
AP900426-0185,41,21,"The 12-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953."
AP900426-0185,42,33,"The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion."
AP900426-0185,43,13,Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope .
AP900427-0083,12,34,"The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument."
AP900427-0083,13,21,"``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,'' Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened."
AP900427-0083,14,12,"``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander Loren J. Shriver."
AP900427-0083,15,29,"``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday."
AP900427-0083,16,9,"``I'll bet it's just that way down there, too''."
AP900427-0083,17,19,The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday.
AP900427-0083,18,19,They had blasted into space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope from its payload bay Wednesday.
AP900427-0083,19,11,"``The Hubble is open for business,'' Mission Control told the astronauts."
AP900427-0083,20,7,"The telescope still was having problems, however."
AP900427-0083,21,28,"When the door opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working and the electronic system went into an automatic ``safe mode'' in which all motion is stopped."
AP900427-0083,22,35,"The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down."
AP900427-0083,23,16,"By early afternoon, a step-by-step procedure was begun to bring the telescope's electronics back on line."
AP900427-0083,24,30,"Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions."
AP900427-0083,25,15,"In addition to the trouble this morning, there two communications outages Thursday totaling several hours."
AP900427-0083,26,7,"``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' he said."
AP900427-0083,27,18,``We've got a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness.
AP900427-0083,28,20,... We'll get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately''.
AP900427-0083,29,11,"NASA announced that ``at this time the telescope is safe, stable''."
AP900427-0083,30,23,"The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if needed."
AP900427-0083,31,22,"Later in the day, the ship was to do an engine firing that would set it on a preliminary path for home."
AP900427-0083,32,11,That path would take the Discovery two miles below the telescope.
AP900427-0083,33,16,"The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter ``aperature door,'' covers the opening to the telescope's light shield."
AP900427-0083,34,8,"When it is closed, the telescope is blind."
AP900427-0083,35,29,The lens cover had been closed _ except for a tiny wedge opening _ ever since the $1.5 billion telescope was dropped overboard by the Discovery crew on Wednesday.
AP900427-0083,36,35,"Now that it is opened, starlight can strike the lens for the first time and it can go about its business of photographing and analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before possible."
AP900427-0083,37,15,The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the outside with solar-reflecting material.
AP900427-0083,38,9,The inside is painted black to absorb stray light.
AP900427-0083,39,22,"If the door opening command had failed, the five Discovery astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the telescope."
AP900427-0083,40,20,Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door Saturday if necessary.
AP900427-0083,41,24,"If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by a day."
AP900427-0083,42,18,"The astronauts were awakened at 2:30 a.m. EDT to the mellow sounds of the Beach Boys' song, ``Kokomo''."
AP900427-0083,43,30,"``For Max Q's keyboard, that's the way that song should really be done,'' Mission Control radioed to mission specialist Steve Hawley, a member of the all-astronaut band called Max Q."
AP900427-0083,44,12,"``Your next practice is Sunday evening in the gym, don't be late''."
AP900427-0083,45,22,Max Q is a NASA acronym for the point in the shuttle's ascent when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point.
AP900427-0083,46,11,"``That sounds just like the way we do it,'' replied Hawley."
AP900427-0083,47,11,"``If you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice''."
AP900427-0083,48,31,"In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth."
AP900427-0083,49,20,It is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
AP900427-0083,50,18,"During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help determine the age and size of the universe."
AP900427-0083,51,22,"It may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life."
AP900427-0083,52,21,"On Tuesday, NASA plans to release its first test image from the telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900427-0083,53,9,Significant data will follow in a month or two.
AP900427-0083,54,21,"The 12-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953."
AP900427-0083,55,34,"The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion ."
AP900427-0146,12,32,"The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction."
AP900427-0146,13,19,"Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to Earth."
AP900427-0146,14,6,``You've been released from Hubble support.
AP900427-0146,15,13,"It's on its own,'' Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members."
AP900427-0146,16,9,"``That's great news,'' replied Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver."
AP900427-0146,17,9,``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here.
AP900427-0146,18,15,"I'll bet it's just that way back down there, too,'' added mission specialist Steven Hawley."
AP900427-0146,19,3,``Who's buying tonight''?
AP900427-0146,20,9,"``We'll buy when you all get back,'' Musgrave replied."
AP900427-0146,21,11,Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.
AP900427-0146,22,13,"`We still have an important part of the mission to go,'' Reeves said."
AP900427-0146,23,12,``We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the ground''.
AP900427-0146,24,15,"Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif."
AP900427-0146,25,31,"Landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture door."
AP900427-0146,26,27,"The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the telescope later in the day."
AP900427-0146,27,30,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900427-0146,28,18,"But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that would be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas."
AP900427-0146,29,9,Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
AP900427-0146,30,32,"Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned, exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first time."
AP900427-0146,31,37,"Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic ``safe mode,'' with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite."
AP900427-0146,32,23,"One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project manager."
AP900427-0146,33,27,"If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the telescope's observing time, Oliver said."
AP900427-0146,34,15,Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been delayed much longer.
AP900427-0146,35,26,"``There has to be a point where you say they have to go their way and we have to go ours,'' he said of the astronauts."
AP900427-0146,36,19,"When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line."
AP900427-0146,37,21,"The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland."
AP900427-0146,38,8,"That, too, kept it in the safe mode."
AP900427-0146,39,17,Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope is brought out of the safe mode.
AP900427-0146,40,19,"It will take another day to get the instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard several days behind."
AP900427-0146,41,38,"``We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly,'' Oliver said."
AP900427-0146,42,21,"``We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make sure it starts off on the right foot''."
AP900427-0146,43,11,NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.
AP900427-0146,44,23,"Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions, Terry said."
AP900427-0146,45,13,"In addition to that trouble, there were two communications outages totaling several hours."
AP900427-0146,46,7,"``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' Terry said."
AP900427-0146,47,18,``We've got a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness.
AP900427-0146,48,20,... We'll get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately''.
AP900427-0146,49,31,Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods.
AP900427-0146,50,17,"The telescope will share the system, known as Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, with other space craft."
AP900427-0146,51,25,"Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the astronauts Wednesday."
AP900427-0146,52,32,"From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe."
AP900427-0146,53,17,The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
AP900427-0146,54,22,"The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation."
AP900427-0146,55,25,"He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away."
AP900427-0146,56,30,"In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering observations."
AP900427-0146,57,27,"``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' she said Friday afternoon."
AP900427-0146,58,13,"Once back on Earth, the eyepiece will be displayed at the observatory ."
AP900428-0050,11,34,"The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations."
AP900428-0050,12,19,"``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope."
AP900428-0050,13,22,"He said the telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing."
AP900428-0050,14,26,"Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight."
AP900428-0050,15,35,"Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe."
AP900428-0050,16,19,"``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden."
AP900428-0050,17,7,``It makes little kids' eyes light up.
AP900428-0050,18,15,It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science''.
AP900428-0050,19,33,"The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite."
AP900428-0050,20,13,The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground.
AP900428-0050,21,39,"Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly."
AP900428-0050,22,12,"``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he said."
AP900428-0050,23,33,"Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed."
AP900428-0050,24,16,"``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode,'' he said."
AP900428-0050,25,42,"Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health."
AP900428-0050,26,32,"It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier."
AP900428-0050,27,18,"``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday."
AP900428-0050,28,9,``This is not the time to do anything dumb''.
AP900428-0050,29,26,"The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule."
AP900428-0050,30,25,"Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather."
AP900428-0050,31,14,Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
AP900428-0050,32,11,Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.
AP900428-0050,33,17,"The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said."
AP900428-0050,34,17,"Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, ``Cosmos''."
AP900428-0050,35,14,"``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver."
AP900428-0050,36,22,"``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield."
AP900428-0050,37,17,The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.
AP900428-0050,38,17,They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.
AP900428-0050,39,28,Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.
AP900428-0050,40,23,The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
AP900428-0050,41,25,Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
AP900428-0050,42,24,"But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time."
AP900428-0050,43,20,"Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line."
AP900428-0050,44,27,"The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard."
AP900428-0050,45,21,"A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions."
AP900428-0050,46,9,There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.
AP900428-0050,47,31,"Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said."
AP900428-0050,48,23,"NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina."
AP900428-0050,49,12,But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.
AP900428-0050,50,9,Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
AP900428-0050,51,32,"The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe."
AP900428-0050,52,17,The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
AP900428-0050,53,10,Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.

AP890925-0009,11,23,"Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a ``sleeping lioness'' that would awake one day with a mighty roar."
AP890925-0009,12,23,"Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe."
AP890925-0009,13,24,"``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner."
AP890925-0009,14,18,``We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago''.
AP890925-0009,15,27,The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate.
AP890925-0009,16,35,"Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union."
AP890925-0009,17,8,The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.
AP890925-0009,18,43,"``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview."
AP890925-0009,19,43,"The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II."
AP890925-0009,20,16,Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar European order mapped out by the conquering Allies.
AP890925-0009,21,18,"It is a prospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland in the East bloc."
AP890925-0009,22,28,"London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe, Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary."
AP890925-0009,23,23,"``Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,'' the Times' futuristic view continued."
AP890925-0009,24,19,``West Germany withdraws from NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for reunification and neutrality''.
AP890925-0009,25,31,"That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms."
AP890925-0009,26,23,"The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many, ominous."
AP890925-0009,27,44,"As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in 1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _ 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans."
AP890925-0009,28,24,"West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors."
AP890925-0009,29,24,"A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc."
AP890925-0009,30,22,Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's boasting that he had brought about ``the unity of the German nation''.
AP890925-0009,31,36,"Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she believes that ``as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward Germany."
AP890925-0009,32,11,``This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.
AP890925-0009,33,11,"Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,'' she added."
AP890925-0009,34,28,"Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow."
AP890925-0009,35,20,"During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that reunification is a ``matter for the Germans to decide''."
AP890925-0009,36,25,"But he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests''."
AP890925-0009,37,27,"For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in Bonn in June, saying only, ``the situation in Europe today was determined by historical realities''."
AP890925-0009,38,13,"Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue."
AP890925-0009,39,26,"``In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrote commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent."
AP890925-0009,40,39,"``The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed''."
AP890925-0009,41,36,"Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a ``hypothesis that cannot be excluded''."
AP890925-0009,42,25,"As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers."
AP890925-0009,43,24,"More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force."
AP890925-0009,44,21,Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.
AP890925-0009,45,19,"During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace."
AP890925-0009,46,19,"``Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water,'' Honecker added on the issue of reunification."
AP890925-0009,47,20,"There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West."
AP890925-0009,48,30,"The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery."
AP890925-0009,49,33,"``After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits."
AP890925-0009,50,31,"The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party."
AP890925-0009,51,10,``Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.
AP890925-0009,52,19,"Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep,'' Maier predicted in 1955."
AP890925-0009,53,16,"``The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar''."
AP890925-0009,54,33,"Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ``I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''"
AP891111-0064,9,35,The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
AP891111-0064,10,32,"The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state, drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and others."
AP891111-0064,11,36,"But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia."
AP891111-0064,12,34,"``No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger."
AP891111-0064,13,40,"It was just 2 months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people."
AP891111-0064,14,27,"While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent."
AP891111-0064,15,19,The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
AP891111-0064,16,38,"``Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom,'' he said."
AP891111-0064,17,27,"As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it, the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a freely elected government takes power in East Germany."
AP891111-0064,18,16,That possibility has been mentioned by East German leaders as part of the ongoing reform process.
AP891111-0064,19,29,"Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a threat to Germany's neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?"
AP891111-0064,20,12,``These are the issues we really have to very hard think about.
AP891111-0064,21,14,We have to think of a new structure between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
AP891111-0064,22,5,That is our new agenda''.
AP891111-0064,23,33,"Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany will be forged as part of a reunited Europe."
AP891111-0064,24,19,"Reunification, Sorenson says, ``will pose problems, because we couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western Alliance."
AP891111-0064,25,16,The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany as part of the Western Alliance.
AP891111-0064,26,20,"``That's why I hope it will be a reunited Europe within which the reunited Germany can take place,'' Sorenson says."
AP891111-0064,27,16,"Bernard Rogers, a former commander of allied forces in Europe, does not think reunification is inevitable."
AP891111-0064,28,9,"Some form of federation, he believes, is more likely."
AP891111-0064,29,28,Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the Warsaw Pact.

AP900214-0157,15,31,``It is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past and lose all perspective of present reality.
AP900214-0157,16,30,``The fears are real because those who bear the scars of the last `unified Germany' do not see their concerns being addressed in the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders''.

AP900215-0013,20,16,"``I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `the house of Europe,''' he said."
AP900215-0013,21,21,"The result of a dominant ``uncomfortably strong'' German state, Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders."
AP900215-0013,22,20,"It could also mean, he said, that American troops might have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany."
AP900215-0013,23,28,"``If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the economy of Western Europe,'' said Charles J."
AP900215-0013,24,8,"Herber of George Washington University, expressing similar concern."
AP900215-0013,25,12,"``Then there would have been fewer chances for German adventurers,'' he said."
AP900215-0013,26,26,"West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings, said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented reunification within the context of European integration."
AP900215-0013,27,13,They wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating Europe.
AP900215-0013,28,16,"``Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of that kind,'' he said."
AP900215-0013,29,14,``We're dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories''.
AP900215-0013,30,36,"For all that, Breitman said, ``One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos''."
AP900215-0013,31,20,"``The only alternative to reunification,'' added Turner, is an East Germany in ruins, ``a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe''."
AP900215-0013,32,10,He said Germans have ``no significant interest in territorial revisions.
AP900215-0013,33,4,Those misgivings are misplaced''.
AP900215-0013,34,24,"Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification, if mishandled, could prove explosive."
AP900215-0013,35,35,"While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said."
AP900215-0013,36,35,"``I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we have to give people _ and the Germans have to give people _ time to think this through and get used to it."
AP900215-0013,37,25,"... Mishandled, reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end''."
AP900215-0013,38,34,"Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ``which worked pretty well'' but was ``abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected''."
AP900215-0013,39,24,"German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to build a new international system, one that ``will prevent the use of international violence''."
AP900215-0013,40,63,"He added, ``We have to be careful that we don't fall back into the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances, rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.''"
AP900321-0057,9,30,The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met to implement the ``final solution'' against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification.
AP900321-0057,10,20,"The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that the meeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day."
AP900321-0057,11,19,"``The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,'' said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress."
AP900321-0057,12,35,"``I think that the place where they decided on the `final solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day''."
AP900321-0057,13,40,"Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70 countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee, Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews."
AP900321-0057,14,19,``Jews have a right to state a moral position on German reunification and we will make a moral statement.
AP900321-0057,15,18,"And part of that moral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happen again,'' Bronfman said."
AP900321-0057,16,29,"In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be ``a very positive thing'' for Europe, but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history."
AP900321-0057,17,20,"For example, Germany's borders ``must be sealed in cement,'' and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons, he said."
AP900321-0057,18,16,Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism once the two Germanys are united.
AP900321-0057,19,12,"In fact, he said, reunification might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings."
AP900321-0057,20,21,"``Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be blaming the Jews'' for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained."
AP900321-0057,21,18,The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration on German reunification will be issued May 8.
AP900321-0057,22,29,"It will be the first meeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress, which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats against Jews ."
FT923-6509,6,33,"Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests."
FT923-6509,7,22,"Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in Germany."
FT923-6509,8,50,"As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish."
FT923-6509,9,16,"In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turn recession into depression."
FT923-6509,10,27,"The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration."
FT923-6509,11,13,Surely there must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?
FT923-6509,12,32,"It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment."
FT923-6509,13,9,"Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary."
FT923-6509,14,21,"But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front."
FT923-6509,15,20,"Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates."
FT923-6509,16,9,"This, despite the unreliability of German money supply data."
FT923-6509,17,37,"The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression."
FT923-6509,18,15,A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to the problems.
FT923-6509,19,8,We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.
FT923-6509,20,19,The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of Bundesbank interest rate policies.
FT923-6509,21,5,And this is aggravating recession.
FT923-6509,22,25,A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US Federal Reserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economic interest.
FT923-6509,23,34,"The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - including the Kohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared to consider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy."

LA021290-0043,23,56,"But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership ."

AP880325-0239,13,10,They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.
AP880325-0239,14,17,Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize.
AP880325-0239,15,24,Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
AP880325-0239,16,32,"The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie ``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun''."
AP880325-0239,17,23,"Although ``Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations, including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks was strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch."
AP880325-0239,18,40,"Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced."
AP880325-0239,19,21,"Brooks did better in 1984 when his ``Terms of Endearment'' took the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director."
AP880325-0239,20,18,"Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year, none of them major and none for director."
AP880325-0239,21,15,"Two years ago, ``The Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director."
AP880325-0239,22,10,The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.
AP880325-0239,23,11,"``I'm floored by this,'' Spielberg said upon receiving his DGA award."

AP880325-0239,25,18,... If some of you are making a statement _ thank God _ I thank you for that''.
AP880325-0239,26,4,Why the Spielberg slight?
AP880325-0239,27,37,"Some observers cite the fact that only 257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history (``Jaws,'' ``E.T."
AP880325-0239,28,6,",'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'')."
AP880325-0239,29,22,The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting Spielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for ``consistently high quality of production''.
AP880325-0239,30,16,"There was no mention of the fact that Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer."
AP880325-0239,31,16,The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who were overlooked for individual awards.
AP880325-0239,32,16,"The recipients have included Cecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman and Mervyn Leroy."
AP880325-0239,33,12,The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's conscience.
AP880325-0239,34,38,Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century''.

AP880325-0239,36,15,"Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who have received honorary awards."
AP880325-0239,37,13,Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an Academy Award.
AP880325-0239,38,22,"``I'd have to blacken my teeth first,'' he quipped, alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums and downtrodden characters."
AP880325-0239,39,23,Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an Oscar: ``I suppose it was a matter of carelessness''.
AP880325-0239,40,18,The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.
AP880325-0239,41,51,"For example, ``Citizen Kane,'' which customarily places No. 1 on polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for best picture (there were 10 nominees in those days), for Orson Welles' performance, direction and co-scripting with Herman Mankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound, music and editing."
AP880325-0239,42,10,The only Oscar for ``Citizen Kane'' was for the script.
AP880325-0239,43,9,``How Green Was My Valley'' was named best picture.
AP880325-0239,44,27,"Billy Wilder's classic comedy, ``Some Like It Hot,'' failed to be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's ``Modern Times,'' Hawks' ``Red River'' and Woody Allen's ``Manhattan''."
AP880325-0239,45,2,"Oh, well."
AP880325-0239,46,5,Oscar might use Joe E.

AP890323-0218,11,26,Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
AP890323-0218,12,35,"And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _ Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, in violation of the rules."
AP890323-0218,13,24,"Secretaries, spouses and friends, several Academy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition."
AP890323-0218,14,18,"``It's like a local election of judges,'' said Academy member Harry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting."
AP890323-0218,15,10,``A lot of people don't know who the candidates are.
AP890323-0218,16,15,So they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is.
AP890323-0218,17,8,"``As far as elections go, it's not bad."
AP890323-0218,18,9,But I've never been through an election in Argentina''.
AP890323-0218,19,30,"Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots."
AP890323-0218,20,14,"``All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned,'' he said."
AP890323-0218,21,12,``Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves''.
AP890323-0218,22,29,"More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles."
AP890323-0218,23,8,Academy members vote on their area of specialty.
AP890323-0218,24,18,"The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories."
AP890323-0218,25,27,"Since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number, Lyle said."
AP890323-0218,26,28,"Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied, he said."
AP890323-0218,27,21,"Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members."
AP890323-0218,28,23,All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories.
AP890323-0218,29,26,"Winners for best documentary feature, best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees."
AP890323-0218,30,15,Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously.
AP890323-0218,31,17,``I don't even vote (in a category) if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.
AP890323-0218,32,18,"... And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I've done some of them''."
AP890323-0218,33,15,"Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken, speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman."
AP890323-0218,34,41,"``Although you're asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank,'' he said."
AP890323-0218,35,31,"Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars."
AP890323-0218,36,21,"``The Last Emperor'' took in $18.9 million, close to half the film's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy."
AP890323-0218,37,19,"More than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture, ``Platoon,'' came after the film was nominated."
AP890323-0218,38,13,"On average, a best picture award is worth about $20 million these days."
AP890323-0218,39,15,"A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio, therefore, can be a good investment."
AP890323-0218,40,30,"In the case of this year's awards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements, banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful."
AP890323-0218,41,36,"This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in December: ``The Accidental Tourist,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Working Girl'' were all released after Dec. 16."
AP890323-0218,42,27,"While these five movies might be good, the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios' mastery of Oscar marketing."
AP890323-0218,43,21,"``I think the Academy Awards are crap,'' said Terry Gilliam, director of ``Brazil'' and the current ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen''."
AP890323-0218,44,10,"``It's about selling films is all it's about,'' he said."
AP890323-0218,45,8,``It's one more way of flogging some films.
AP890323-0218,46,16,"When `Brazil' got nominated (in 1986), they asked me to be a member of the Academy."
AP890323-0218,47,4,And I wouldn't join.
AP890323-0218,48,12,I just don't want to be a part of that at all''.
AP890323-0218,49,21,"And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner, says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths."
AP890323-0218,50,30,"Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for Sigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' could lead him to vote against the film."
AP890323-0218,51,27,"``I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver and a beautiful gorilla than I need,'' Reiner said of promotional material sent to his home."
AP890323-0218,52,10,``We've got to tell the Academy to stop this advertising.

AP890324-0014,10,16,"Free enterprise has collided with the Academy Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces."
AP890324-0014,11,42,"With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones, the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism."
AP890324-0014,12,43,"``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain,'' said Bruce Davis, the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter."
AP890324-0014,13,47,"But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism, this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages."
AP890324-0014,14,35,"When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world."
AP890324-0014,15,12,"``It seemed like a good marketing opportunity,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ira Gleser."
AP890324-0014,16,20,``The Academy approached our local bottler in Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people''.
AP890324-0014,17,26,"But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the Oscar name."
AP890324-0014,18,31,"When MGM-UA, the distributor of ``Rain Man,'' published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble."
AP890324-0014,19,9,"After the ads appeared, ``Rain Man'' collected nine nominations."
AP890324-0014,20,20,"``We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated our concern,'' said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy."
AP890324-0014,21,18,"For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners."
AP890324-0014,22,12,It also has envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.
AP890324-0014,23,9,So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy.
AP890324-0014,24,59,"The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley'' ($17,715)."
AP890324-0014,25,21,None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block.
AP890324-0014,26,44,"When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' the Academy said enough, initiating a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales."
AP890324-0014,27,29,The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
AP890324-0014,28,29,"``But now that the word is out that these awards are worth $10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the Academy for $10,'' Willits said."
AP890324-0014,29,9,``The Academy has created something of great value here.
AP890324-0014,30,15,This is the most famous award in the world _ the most instantly recognizable award.
AP890324-0014,31,19,"The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people know more about what an Academy Award looks like."
AP890324-0014,32,5,"``And they're very limited, too."
AP890324-0014,33,7,There's not too many of them around.
AP890324-0014,34,20,"... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster in your living room unless you were a college student."
AP890324-0014,35,22,"Now, you can go into Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn thing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars''."
AP890324-0014,36,17,"When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking future auctions, Willits decided to sell his store."
AP890324-0014,37,7,``It seemed to be the final straw.
AP890324-0014,38,6,"I don't like lawsuits,'' he said."
AP890324-0014,39,10,``I'm getting older and I'd like to write movie scripts''.
AP890324-0014,40,34,Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a California federal court.
AP890324-0014,41,22,"The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically identical'' to the Oscar."
AP890324-0014,42,5,The court found otherwise .
AP890330-0123,9,18,"Spencer Tracy's acting technique was simply ``less is better,'' and that helped make him the screen's greatest actor."
AP890330-0123,10,12,The Tracy credo is recommended to future producers of Academy Award shows.
AP890330-0123,11,14,"Wednesday night's orgy of self-congratulation was dazzling, glamorous and all those familiar Hollywood adjectives."
AP890330-0123,12,3,Also too much.
AP890330-0123,13,5,Too many endless production numbers.
AP890330-0123,14,6,Too much forced conversation between couples.
AP890330-0123,15,10,Too many awards with meaning lost to the general public.
AP890330-0123,16,23,"The use of ``couples, co-stars, compadres and companions,'' as presenters for the 61st Academy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium was clever but wearing."
AP890330-0123,17,27,"The best Oscar shows have been emceed by Will Rogers, Bob Hope, Johnny Carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity."
AP890330-0123,18,22,"The brightest moments of the 61st Awards came from Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Bob Hope, but they were all too brief."
AP890330-0123,19,17,Tom Selleck remarked that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. handed out the first awards in 1929 in five minutes.
AP890330-0123,20,23,The present awards could be staged in two hours instead of the 3 hours and 15 minutes they took Wednesday night on ABC-TV.
AP890330-0123,21,7,But the show will never be shorter.

AP891110-0043,9,22,"The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled."
AP891110-0043,10,12,"The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S."
AP891110-0043,11,11,District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.
AP891110-0043,12,28,"The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar."
AP891110-0043,13,13,Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling ``comes as a shock to me''.
AP891110-0043,14,6,The academy said it would appeal.
AP891110-0043,15,26,"The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition."
AP891110-0043,16,24,"The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword."
AP891110-0043,17,21,"It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base."
AP891110-0043,18,46,"Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is ``very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976."
AP891110-0043,19,23,The film industry's top award was distributed from the first ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the ``c'' mark indicating a copyright.
AP891110-0043,20,36,"The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a ``limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright act."
AP891110-0043,21,31,The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
AP891110-0043,22,42,"``We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades,'' Malden said in a statement ."
AP900220-0065,7,30,"Spike Lee may have been wearing a Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from Academy Award voters."
AP900220-0065,8,28,"In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, ``Do the Right Thing,'' and blamed it on generational politics."
AP900220-0065,9,23,"The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director."
AP900220-0065,10,12,"The academy's membership consists mainly of ``old people,'' the 32-year-old Lee said."
AP900220-0065,11,24,He said they were ``a lot more comfortable with the black chauffeur in `Driving Miss Daisy''' than with the angry characters in his film.
AP900220-0065,12,13,"``I still feel we made the best film of the year,'' he said."
AP900220-0065,13,17,"Asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations, Lee replied, ``Racism's involved in everything''."
AP900220-0065,14,14,"Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed him as one of their own."
AP900220-0065,15,31,"``He's an African-American, one of the first ones to make it (as a producer and director), and he's addressing the issues and concerns affecting our community,'' Syracuse senior Deron Harris said."

LA033089-0190,18,39,"Whether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a film to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process ."
LA033089-0190,19,36,"That ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 film sure to be regarded as a classic ."
LA033089-0190,20,19,The good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films that were not box-office hits.
LA033089-0190,21,32,"The voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful (thus: ""Rain Man""), and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned ."
LA033089-0190,22,37,"This year, several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers at the box office: Jodie Foster as best actress from ""The Accused,"" Geena Davis as best supporting actress from ""The Accidental Tourist"" ."
LA033089-0190,23,29,"More surprising were the awards given to ""Bird"" and ""The Milagro Beanfield War,"" films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives ."
LA033089-0190,24,37,"Both films were flawed, but the sound editing done for ""Bird,"" which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won ."
LA033089-0190,25,24,"David Grusin's Oscar for scoring ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" overcame even bigger odds, winning over popular John Williams' score for ""The Accidental Tourist"" ."
LA033089-0190,26,33,"The selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a trend ."
LA033089-0190,27,14,"The 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years."
LA033089-0190,28,24,The industry is still adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding audience -- and that means a wider variety of films.

LA033189-0114,9,33,"The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition ."
LA033189-0114,10,22,"The famous fairy tale character, portrayed by singer-dancer Eileen Bowman, opened Wednesday night's Academy Awards ceremonies with an elaborate, 10-minute song-and-dance routine."
LA033189-0114,11,16,But Disney contends that the character was used on the show without the company's permission .
LA033189-0114,12,27,"""We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does,"" Frank Wells, Disney's president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared statement."
LA033189-0114,13,30,"""We were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character had been used extensively without our permission"" ."
LA033189-0114,14,32,"Wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character, which debuted in a 1937 full-length cartoon film ."
LA033189-0114,15,20,"""If such a statement had been agreed to by the academy,"" Wells said, ""we would have considered the matter ended."

LA033189-0114,19,22,"""We haven't gotten any official notification of this,"" Davis said, adding that he learned of the legal action from a reporter ."

LA033189-0114,23,17,"But in its suit, Disney says a company representative learned of the plans early in the week."
LA033189-0114,24,16,The company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon .
LA033189-0114,25,41,"At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, ""through a legal representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White"" ."

AP890922-0007,13,28,Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
AP890922-0007,14,38,"``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston, where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode."
AP890922-0007,15,28,"``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city."
AP890922-0007,16,15,``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life''.
AP890922-0007,17,9,"By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston."
AP890922-0007,18,25,"The roof cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber."
AP890922-0007,19,11,Phone and electric service to the command post was knocked out.
AP890922-0007,20,43,"Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla."
AP890922-0007,21,34,"The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135 mph. Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast."
AP890922-0007,22,27,"The storm posed a 19 percent chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said."
AP890922-0007,23,25,"As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach, 200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort towns themselves."
AP890922-0007,24,13,Power lines and trees were downed in some spots and water flooded roads.
AP890922-0007,25,11,Stop lights and neon lights were knocked out in Myrtle Beach.
AP890922-0007,26,19,"``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach."
AP890922-0007,27,15,"In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs, palmetto fronds and chunks of bark."
AP890922-0007,28,11,Businesses were closed and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
AP890922-0007,29,8,Riley ordered residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
AP890922-0007,30,24,"Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients, officials said."
AP890922-0007,31,36,"About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220 miles northwest of here."
AP890922-0007,32,29,"``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach."
AP890922-0007,33,14,"``We tried to post guards at the doors, but people were still coming in''."
AP890922-0007,34,24,"American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who appealed for help."
AP890922-0007,35,17,``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of people all along the Eastern seaboard.
AP890922-0007,36,21,"This of course is at the same time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the other Caribbean islands."
AP890922-0007,37,6,``We're beginning to feel the squeeze.
AP890922-0007,38,5,Our resources are very tight.
AP890922-0007,39,17,Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade''.
AP890922-0007,40,19,"At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said."
AP890922-0007,41,13,The hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
AP890922-0007,42,24,"Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from 125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before."
AP890922-0007,43,20,"North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center."
AP890922-0007,44,20,"The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said."
AP890922-0007,45,14,"A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C."
AP890922-0007,46,28,"By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category, which indicated it could cause extreme damage."
AP890922-0007,47,23,"``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians."
AP890922-0007,48,35,"The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m."
AP890922-0007,49,24,"``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean off.''"

AP890922-0049,11,28,"This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo."
AP890922-0049,12,14,"The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night."
AP890922-0049,13,49,"``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959."
AP890922-0049,14,12,"The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both natural and man-made."
AP890922-0049,15,29,"The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage."
AP890922-0049,16,20,"Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861."
AP890922-0049,17,27,"The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians of refinement as ``September gales''."
AP890922-0049,18,33,"But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day."
AP890922-0049,19,15,The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago and New York City.
AP890922-0049,20,30,"Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets."
AP890922-0049,21,23,"In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches."
AP890922-0049,22,17,"Charleston has received international acclaim as home to Spoleto Festival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti."
AP890922-0049,23,14,Organizers like to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive arts festival .
AP890922-0072,10,28,"Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo."
AP890922-0072,11,14,"``The whole system looks chaotic, but it works,'' said Bob Sheets, the center's director."
AP890922-0072,12,36,"On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas."
AP890922-0072,13,27,"On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and tidbits of his expertise."
AP890922-0072,14,6,In the center was Sheets himself.
AP890922-0072,15,34,"Surrounded by cameras, wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo."
AP890922-0072,16,24,"During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shout and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of Sheets."
AP890922-0072,17,19,"At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working 12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites."
AP890922-0072,18,25,"``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane specialist Max Mayfield."
AP890922-0072,19,12,"``In the Caribbean, we were not so certain the word got out."
AP890922-0072,20,8,But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated''.
AP890922-0072,21,35,"When a hurricane warning goes into effect, ``It's a $50 million statement,'' said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted."
AP890922-0072,22,16,"``If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out there,'' he said."
AP890922-0072,23,18,"Before the hurricane warning system was established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives."
AP890922-0072,24,30,"But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South Carolina."
AP890922-0072,25,18,"``I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives are concerned,'' Cline said."
AP890922-0072,26,24,"After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last several days."
AP890922-0072,27,31,"But, he warned, the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in the Pacific."
AP890922-0072,28,27,"``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death,'' meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as the storm pounded Charleston, S.C."
AP890922-0072,29,6,``But we've done all we can.''
AP890922-0167,10,28,"Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast."
AP890922-0167,11,7,But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
AP890922-0167,12,16,"Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C."
AP890922-0167,13,30,"``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service."
AP890922-0167,14,22,"Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation."
AP890922-0167,15,32,"``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner,'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie."
AP890922-0167,16,28,"The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston."
AP890922-0167,17,21,"``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said."
AP890922-0167,18,11,``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength''.
AP890922-0167,19,21,"The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance."
AP890922-0167,20,28,"Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships."
AP890922-0167,21,18,"``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said."
AP890922-0167,22,16,"In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture."
AP890922-0167,23,20,Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
AP890922-0167,24,39,"Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane."
AP890922-0167,25,26,"To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane."
AP890922-0167,26,9,Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
AP890922-0167,27,16,Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
AP890922-0167,28,27,"``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said."
AP890922-0167,29,22,"Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path."
AP890922-0167,30,25,"``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,'' Emmanuel said."
AP890922-0167,31,18,Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
AP890922-0167,32,28,"``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.''"
AP890922-0193,9,15,Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path across the Caribbean into South Carolina:

AP890923-0035,13,23,"That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today."
AP890923-0035,14,19,"Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage."
AP890923-0035,15,8,It was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded.
AP890923-0035,16,28,"Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
AP890923-0035,17,36,"But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said."
AP890923-0035,18,23,"Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here."
AP890923-0035,19,30,"Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s."
AP890923-0035,20,9,He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.
AP890923-0035,21,32,"Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said."
AP890923-0035,22,11,"``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' he said."
AP890923-0035,23,13,``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will have stronger hurricanes''.
AP890923-0035,24,25,"Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts will be even stronger."
AP890923-0035,25,36,"Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest."
AP890923-0035,26,46,"The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked."
AP890923-0035,27,19,"It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up, the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler."
AP890923-0035,28,6,But he said that is unlikley.
AP890923-0035,29,9,"``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said."
AP890923-0035,30,11,``And that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''
AP890925-0054,10,32,"Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said."
AP890925-0054,11,30,"The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds."
AP890925-0054,12,13,"``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr."
AP890925-0054,13,26,``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death''.
AP890925-0054,14,19,"Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings."
AP890925-0054,15,21,"The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida."
AP890925-0054,16,20,"Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings."
AP890925-0054,17,16,"``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service."
AP890925-0054,18,9,"``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said."
AP890925-0054,19,5,``This time they realized it''.
AP890925-0054,20,20,"Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters."
AP890925-0054,21,15,Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
AP890925-0054,22,19,"Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings."
AP890925-0054,23,13,"``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said."
AP890925-0054,24,10,``You've just got to say nice things about the people''.
AP890925-0054,25,20,"Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing."
AP890925-0054,26,10,"``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said ."
LA092789-0093,9,27,The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
LA092789-0093,10,18,Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry .
LA092789-0093,11,27,"State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said."
LA092789-0093,12,24,"The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said ."
LA092789-0093,13,39,"Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985 ."
LA092789-0093,14,23,"""Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston."
LA092789-0093,15,23,"There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage"" as in Hugo, Parsons said."
LA092789-0093,16,34,"Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C ."
LA092789-0093,17,4,Losses Still Being Tallied
LA092789-0093,18,28,"Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina."
LA092789-0093,19,12,"""We have so far received 16,000 claims,"" spokesman Bob Sohozich said ."
LA092789-0093,20,44,"Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said ."
LA092789-0093,21,17,The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.
LA092789-0093,22,29,"Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs."
LA092789-0093,23,26,"For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages."
LA092789-0093,24,32,Reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies .
LA092789-0093,25,38,"Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies ."
LA092789-0093,26,26,"Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm."
LA092789-0093,27,22,"The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force ."
LA092789-0093,28,4,Forecasts May Be Cut
LA092789-0093,29,23,"The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York."
LA092789-0093,30,14,"""If there is a profit, it will be a very small one,"" he said."
LA092789-0093,31,14,"The charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25%, he added ."
LA092789-0093,32,37,"Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for Cigna Corp., USF&G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings ."
LA092789-0093,33,22,"Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest."
LA092789-0093,34,27,"But ""this could be a positive for the industry,"" Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized."
LA092789-0093,35,30,"Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have ""a significant impact on excess capital,"" he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly ."
LA092789-0093,36,12,"""That would be good for the companies and shareholders,"" he said ."

WSJ890928-0084,9,21,"Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers."
WSJ890928-0084,10,22,New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
WSJ890928-0084,11,29,Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
WSJ890928-0084,12,17,"AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas."
WSJ890928-0084,13,18,"St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million."
WSJ890928-0084,14,18,"That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said."
WSJ890928-0084,15,15,Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
WSJ890928-0084,16,35,"Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis."
WSJ890928-0084,17,16,That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
WSJ890928-0084,18,37,"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster."
WSJ890928-0084,19,18,"When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million."
WSJ890928-0084,20,27,"It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983 ."
AP880911-0016,9,28,"Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas."

AP880914-0027,9,27,"With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere."
AP880914-0027,10,31,"Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center, reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday."
AP880914-0027,11,7,Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
AP880914-0027,12,12,"``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,'' Zimmer said."
AP880914-0027,13,31,"The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said."
AP880914-0027,14,24,"With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of the largest."
AP880914-0027,15,26,"But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore."
AP880914-0027,16,25,"Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably about half that size, Moore said."
AP880914-0027,17,19,Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records.
AP880914-0027,18,34,"The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead."
AP880914-0027,19,14,"A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however."
AP880914-0027,20,13,"That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people."
AP880914-0027,21,24,"Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet."
AP880914-0027,22,32,"The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities."
AP880914-0027,23,23,"Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said."
AP880914-0027,24,29,"The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _ shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed."
AP880914-0027,25,10,"``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' Zimmer said."
AP880914-0027,26,14,"``The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air in the center."
AP880914-0027,27,26,"If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane''."
AP880914-0027,28,23,"Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90."
AP880914-0027,29,25,"The weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more ."
AP880914-0131,11,17,Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains.

AP880711-0056,10,37,"If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported."
AP880711-0056,11,32,"As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said."

AP880711-0221,14,39,"Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States ``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand,'' he said."

AP900616-0032,16,8,Allan Hans called the flooding ``the devil's work''.
AP900616-0032,17,13,"``I lost everything but my car and the clothes I'm wearing,'' he said."

AP900616-0123,14,39,"Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles south of this town."
AP900616-0123,15,21,"Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south."

AP900616-0123,24,10,``I saw my husband go under and get washed away.
AP900616-0123,25,16,"He was yelling how much he loved me, and then I went under,'' Mrs. Hulderman said."
AP900616-0123,26,27,"``I began praying `God, don't let me die like this,' and the next thing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down''."
AP900616-0123,27,17,Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at the mouth of the creek near the Ohio River.
AP900616-0123,28,21,Capt. James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said local authorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccounted for.

AP900618-0018,13,35,"Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard Capt. Jim Boling."
AP900618-0018,14,10,Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
AP900618-0018,15,5,Four bodies were found Sunday.
AP900618-0018,16,20,"But two of those were not immediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised to account for them."
AP900618-0018,17,43,"The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was safe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area, said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt."
AP900618-0018,18,23,"The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at the Ohio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said."
AP900618-0018,19,20,"Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodies were found earlier in the Ohio, he said."

AP900618-0018,21,12,"Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims, said Boling."
AP900618-0018,22,13,"The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia."
AP900618-0018,23,29,"``The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart and searched separately,'' Badia said."
AP900618-0018,24,8,``Everything you turn up creates a different situation''.
AP900618-0018,25,13,But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive.
AP900618-0018,26,5,``It's just been too long.
AP900618-0018,27,10,"I don't think there's anybody alive out there,'' he said."
AP900618-0018,28,11,``You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River''.
AP900618-0018,29,22,The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during storms that poured 5 inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3 hours.
AP900618-0018,30,14,The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others.
AP900618-0018,31,23,"Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those were later found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe."

AP900618-0018,34,22,Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of threebridges over the creeks.
AP900618-0018,35,16,"Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge."
AP900618-0018,36,7,The ``dams'' broke under the water pressure.
AP900618-0018,37,7,``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
AP900618-0018,38,16,"The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,'' he said."
AP900618-0018,39,16,"As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area."

AP900618-0018,42,7,No deaths or serious injuries were reported.
AP900618-0018,43,14,Caperton toured flooded areas in Wheeling and the Doolin Run community near New Martinsville.
AP900618-0018,44,14,"He said he saw ``tremendous devastation'' to hundreds of houses, house trailers and cars."
AP900618-0018,45,18,"State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated that repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about $750,000."

AP900618-0069,12,36,"The death toll from last week's flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing."
AP900618-0069,13,5,``It's just been too long.
AP900618-0069,14,8,I don't think there's anybody alive out there.
AP900618-0069,15,18,"You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,'' said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator."
AP900618-0069,16,17,The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when a thunderstorm rolled through the area.
AP900618-0069,17,21,"Heavy rain fell for about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood."
AP900618-0069,18,22,"By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most damage."
AP900618-0069,19,19,Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said there were no immediate reports of additional property damage.
AP900618-0069,20,27,"The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator."
AP900618-0069,21,34,"The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said."
AP900618-0069,22,7,One of the recovered bodies remains unidentified.
AP900618-0069,23,17,Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that other people not on the list could be missing.
AP900618-0069,24,5,Four bodies were recovered Sunday.
AP900618-0069,25,35,"Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those later were found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of the area."
AP900618-0069,26,16,Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5 inches of rain in 3 hours.
AP900618-0069,27,14,The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others.
AP900618-0069,28,28,Most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely without benefit of insurance.
AP900618-0069,29,25,"Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said."
AP900618-0069,30,9,``We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance.
AP900618-0069,31,2,For what?
AP900618-0069,32,4,That creek never flooded.
AP900618-0069,33,2,Then this.
AP900618-0069,34,8,"Everybody just got wiped out,'' said Julia Kulazenka."
AP900618-0069,35,23,"Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said."
AP900618-0069,36,7,``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
AP900618-0069,37,16,"The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,'' Badia said."
AP900618-0069,38,22,The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his death last July was damaged as Wegee Creek raged out of control.
AP900618-0069,39,20,"She said replacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and her son owned would cost more than $80,000."
AP900618-0069,40,9,``They told us homeowners' won't do us no good.
AP900618-0069,41,19,"So unless the government helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with this place,'' Mrs. Kulazenka said."
AP900618-0069,42,28,The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open an office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept applications from residents for low-interest loans and grants to help them rebuild.

LA061890-0066,11,31,The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
LA061890-0066,12,5,Eighteen people remained missing .
LA061890-0066,13,37,"Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents, National Guard Capt. Jim Boling said ."

AP880428-0041,9,36,"New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes."
AP880428-0041,10,21,Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
AP880428-0041,11,20,"They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills."
AP880428-0041,12,14,"``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J. Topol, the study's director."
AP880428-0041,13,8,``There were no problems with any serious events''.
AP880428-0041,14,21,"Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty."
AP880428-0041,15,18,"When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage."
AP880428-0041,16,14,Angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons.
AP880428-0041,17,23,The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays.
AP880428-0041,18,21,"However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted."
AP880428-0041,19,20,"In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack."
AP880428-0041,20,20,"When President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital."
AP880428-0041,21,11,"However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good."
AP880428-0041,22,11,"Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became demoralized."
AP880428-0041,23,17,"In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks."
AP880428-0041,24,12,"Now, doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days."
AP880428-0041,25,24,"In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge."
AP880428-0041,26,12,"None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain or heart failure."
AP880428-0041,27,9,Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage.
AP880428-0041,28,16,"Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days."
AP880428-0041,29,19,"After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar."
AP880428-0041,30,31,"However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868."
AP880428-0041,31,26,"The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million."
AP880428-0041,32,32,"In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays."
AP880428-0041,33,30,"``This single study,'' he wrote, ``is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated'' heart attacks ."
AP880818-0088,9,39,"A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine."
AP880818-0088,10,25,"Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said."
AP880818-0088,11,24,"Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said."
AP880818-0088,12,43,"The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study."
AP880818-0088,13,25,"The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said."
AP880818-0088,14,28,But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack.
AP880818-0088,15,14,"``We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,'' Moss said."
AP880818-0088,16,7,``That's what this study was all about''.
AP880818-0088,17,20,"Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease."
AP880818-0088,18,12,Nitrates and beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors.
AP880818-0088,19,20,"The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were given either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo."
AP880818-0088,20,14,Patients were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.
AP880818-0088,21,17,"Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said."
AP880818-0088,22,35,"But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump function _ 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _ diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent, Moss said."
AP880818-0088,23,25,"In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent."
AP880818-0088,24,33,"Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher."
AP880818-0088,25,20,"``But the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective,'' Schroeder said."
AP880818-0088,26,19,``I think it will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on a long-term basis''.
AP880818-0088,27,30,"Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at the University of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion."
AP880818-0088,28,14,"``This is one of the first reports that seems to identify that,'' he said."
AP880818-0088,29,30,"Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages."
AP880818-0088,30,18,"Nitrates have been used for more than 50 years, and beta blockers were developed in the 1960s ."
AP880829-0222,11,19,"Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks earlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches."
AP880829-0222,12,25,"A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half."
AP880829-0222,13,31,The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
AP880829-0222,14,34,"In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack."
AP880829-0222,15,22,"Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers found."
AP880829-0222,16,9,"With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent."
AP880829-0222,17,26,"``The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce in-hospital mortality substantially,'' says Richard Peto of Oxford University, one of the study's authors."
AP880829-0222,18,11,"Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, by far."
AP880829-0222,19,16,"The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820 Americans died of heart disease in 1987."
AP880829-0222,20,22,"To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died that year, more than one in three died of heart disease."
AP880829-0222,21,13,"(This does not include those who died of blood-vessel diseases, such as strokes)."
AP880829-0222,22,21,"The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby, aspirin."
AP880829-0222,23,21,"The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood."
AP880829-0222,24,12,"The blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted blood."
AP880829-0222,25,8,"Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow."
AP880829-0222,26,17,"Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping to prevent clot formation in the first place."
AP880829-0222,27,24,"The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite their proven success."
AP880829-0222,28,6,But that is beginning to change.
AP880829-0222,29,34,Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital.
AP880829-0222,30,43,"``We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis,'' says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers."
AP880829-0222,31,20,"``The most important thing we can do is teach patients in advance about the value of early treatment,'' he says."
AP880829-0222,32,30,"While most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks, researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks."
AP880829-0222,33,28,Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.
AP880829-0222,34,16,Most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.
AP880829-0222,35,20,The patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group.
AP880829-0222,36,12,"After six months, not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group."
AP880829-0222,37,18,The researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days.
AP880829-0222,38,42,"In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks."
AP880829-0222,39,28,All of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk.
AP880829-0222,40,30,"Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk."
AP880829-0222,41,34,"U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his first report on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry and whole grains."
AP880829-0222,42,23,"The report has been likened to the first Surgeon Generals report on smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention on smoking's hazards."
AP880829-0222,43,21,"Koop's recommendations largely echo those of the American Heart Association, but they should help carry the message to many more people."
AP880829-0222,44,28,Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against.
AP880829-0222,45,22,"Much can be done to prevent heart attacks, great improvements are being made in treatments, and recovery is faster than ever before."
AP880829-0222,46,20,"The use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save 25,000 lives a year in the United States, doctors say."
AP880829-0222,47,14,"``These results,'' says Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University, ``will change medical practice worldwide.''"
AP881115-0113,9,36,"The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday."
AP881115-0113,10,27,"The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty."
AP881115-0113,11,27,"Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available."
AP881115-0113,12,8,The study also has an important financial message.
AP881115-0113,13,23,"Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million."
AP881115-0113,14,15,"``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr."
AP881115-0113,15,9,"J. Ward Kennedy of the University of Washington, Seattle."
AP881115-0113,16,26,"The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston."
AP881115-0113,17,29,"The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival."
AP881115-0113,18,34,"The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA."
AP881115-0113,19,32,"At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit."
AP881115-0113,20,21,"Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure, which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open."
AP881115-0113,21,8,"A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA."
AP881115-0113,22,20,But they were not considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or abnormal exercise tests during their recovery.
AP881115-0113,23,28,"After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those in the comparison group."
AP881115-0113,24,11,"A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival."
AP881115-0113,25,9,About 93 percent of both groups were still alive.
AP881115-0113,26,13,"``There does not appear to be any additional benefit from angioplasty,'' Braunwald said."
AP881115-0113,27,26,"Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented, ``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery''."
AP881115-0113,28,24,"While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed."
AP881115-0113,29,32,"If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure."
AP881115-0113,30,12,``The watch word is watchful waiting'' to see if patients need angioplasty.
AP881115-0113,31,35,"``This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed,'' said Dr. Howard Morgan, immediate past president of the heart association."
AP881115-0113,32,14,Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle.
AP881115-0113,33,16,The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies.
AP881115-0113,34,19,"To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms."
AP881115-0113,35,19,Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs.
AP881115-0113,36,11,Many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs.
AP881115-0113,37,18,"In others, the treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery or a history of strokes."
AP881115-0113,38,19,Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks.
AP881115-0113,39,14,The latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty .
AP890115-0014,10,35,"Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart Association said Sunday."
AP890115-0014,11,24,"``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr."
AP890115-0014,12,14,"Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president of the heart association."
AP890115-0014,13,12,"``Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing,'' she said."
AP890115-0014,14,24,"``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go''."
AP890115-0014,15,12,The association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers.
AP890115-0014,16,24,"Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food, and improved medical treatment."
AP890115-0014,17,28,"``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University."
AP890115-0014,18,3,``It's almost unbelievable.
AP890115-0014,19,15,There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment''.
AP890115-0014,20,29,"However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health."
AP890115-0014,21,40,"``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify and treat hypertension,'' he said."
AP890115-0014,22,13,Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed the heart.
AP890115-0014,23,11,"It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal heart ailment."
AP890115-0014,24,35,"Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels."
AP890115-0014,25,8,"Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives."
AP890115-0014,26,16,"Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms of cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent."
AP890115-0014,27,12,It declined 28 percent for heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.
AP890115-0014,28,26,"The association's figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it."
AP890115-0014,29,15,About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital.
AP890115-0014,30,21,Studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room.
AP890115-0014,31,26,Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks.
AP890115-0014,32,22,"During this period, there is still time to give them drugs to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks."
AP890115-0014,33,12,This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart attacks.
AP890115-0014,34,40,"Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest."
AP890115-0014,35,19,The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.
AP890115-0014,36,21,"Among other statistics released by the association: _The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure, which affects 60 million Americans."
AP890115-0014,37,16,"_About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each year occur in people under age 65."
AP890115-0014,38,15,"_There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as many as in 1983."
AP890115-0014,39,14,"_About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest pain resulting from clogged heart arteries."
AP890115-0014,40,6,"About 300,000 new cases occur annually."
AP890115-0014,41,13,_As many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks this year .
AP900322-0112,10,33,"A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday."
AP900322-0112,11,26,"The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil, known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1 years after a heart attack."
AP900322-0112,12,15,Calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.
AP900322-0112,13,32,"``This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction,'' or heart attack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida."
AP900322-0112,14,26,"Several other studies of calcium blockers, including one large U.S. study published last year, failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks."
AP900322-0112,15,27,"According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks."
AP900322-0112,16,23,"While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment."
AP900322-0112,17,8,``We feel it is important to have alternatives.
AP900322-0112,18,23,"Many patients do not tolerate beta blockers,'' said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard of Central County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of the study."
AP900322-0112,19,12,Beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with asthma and emphysema.
AP900322-0112,20,18,"This means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks."
AP900322-0112,21,24,"In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with 878 people who took placebos."
AP900322-0112,22,27,"After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurring heart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 in people who got the dummy medication."
AP900322-0112,23,14,"``We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with Verapamil,'' said Dr."
AP900322-0112,24,7,Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal Hospital.
AP900322-0112,25,32,"``If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18 months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period,'' he said."
AP900322-0112,26,4,``Then it levels off.
AP900322-0112,27,4,That's what we demonstrated.
AP900322-0112,28,2,It worked''.
AP900322-0112,29,35,"The researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work needed by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockers lowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's own muscle is deprived of oxygen."
AP900322-0112,30,19,They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks.
AP900322-0112,31,14,"However, they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking beta blockers."
AP900322-0112,32,10,And this might have obscured any benefits from calcium blockers.
AP900322-0112,33,13,The results were presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
AP900322-0112,34,8,Among other research described at the meeting: _Dr.
AP900322-0112,35,40,"James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year study found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing blockages in the arteries feeding the heart, although it may modestly protect against the development of new deposits."
AP900322-0112,36,16,"However, like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks."
AP900322-0112,37,27,_Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the next phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina.
AP900322-0112,38,19,This is a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work or stress.
AP900322-0112,39,13,"Until now, the drugs have been used only to treat heart attacks ."
AP900705-0149,9,31,"A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science."
AP900705-0149,10,43,"In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta."
AP900705-0149,11,26,"``TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack,'' said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at Jefferson."
AP900705-0149,12,19,Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
AP900705-0149,13,10,"In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo."
AP900705-0149,14,10,"In the other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta."
AP900705-0149,15,18,"For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, ``the damage from the attack was much less severe."
AP900705-0149,16,13,There was about 50 percent less injury with TGF beta than without it''.
AP900705-0149,17,22,The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
AP900705-0149,18,20,"Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer."
AP900705-0149,19,17,"Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage."
AP900705-0149,20,29,"Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack."
AP900705-0149,21,18,Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.
AP900705-0149,22,29,"TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack."
AP900705-0149,23,25,"Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by Genentech, a California biotechnology firm."
AP900705-0149,24,31,Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
AP900705-0149,25,16,"Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia."
AP900705-0149,26,18,"Science, which published the study, is the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ."
AP901003-0006,9,26,"An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today."
AP901003-0006,10,19,"The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years."
AP901003-0006,11,18,"In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed."
AP901003-0006,12,12,This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
AP901003-0006,13,15,"The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks."
AP901003-0006,14,21,The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
AP901003-0006,15,24,"During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent."
AP901003-0006,16,12,"In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent."
AP901003-0006,17,27,"Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment."
AP901003-0006,18,20,"``It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack,'' Buchwald said."
AP901003-0006,19,23,"``It is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy, including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack''."
AP901003-0006,20,19,"Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions."
AP901003-0006,21,22,"The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine."
AP901003-0006,22,22,"Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts."
AP901003-0006,23,24,"Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question."
AP901003-0006,24,17,"``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid (cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,'' Buchwald said."
AP901003-0006,25,21,"``It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol controversy''."
AP901003-0006,26,25,"In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone."
AP901003-0006,27,12,"At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251."
AP901003-0006,28,7,The surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent.
AP901003-0006,29,26,The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts.
AP901003-0006,30,19,The surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries .
WSJ880603-0129,6,25,"Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value, the Food and Drug Administration said."
WSJ880603-0129,7,33,"Taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, the agency said in a commentary in today's Journal of the American Medical Association."
WSJ880603-0129,8,23,"The FDA persuaded aspirin makers in March to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now."
WSJ880603-0129,9,35,"A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compared with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute."
WSJ880603-0129,10,16,Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots.
WSJ880603-0129,11,19,Heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply.
WSJ880603-0129,12,34,"But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems, or for those who have high blood pressure, which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA commentary said."
WSJ880603-0129,13,24,Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding.
WSJ880603-0129,14,30,"The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute."
WSJ880603-0129,15,20,"Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower."
WSJ880603-0129,16,16,There were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group.
WSJ880603-0129,17,32,"""Physicians, will, for a time, be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information,"" said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E."
WSJ880603-0129,18,20,"Young. ""We agree with them completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard University researcher who participated in the aspirin study."
WSJ880603-0129,19,27,"She added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in late fall."
WSJ880603-0129,20,38,"The commentary noted a British study, also released in January, of 5,000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks, and that it was associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes ."
WSJ910418-0105,13,29,"The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attacks."
WSJ910418-0105,14,35,"About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure."
WSJ910418-0105,15,16,It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks.
WSJ910418-0105,16,37,"The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital."
WSJ910418-0105,17,21,"""In our hands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost the patient $40 to $80,"" he said."
WSJ910418-0105,18,20,"Dr. Laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test, which was developed by his wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey."
WSJ910418-0105,19,12,"The test, which isn't patented, is available in kit form to laboratories."
WSJ910418-0105,20,23,The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.
WSJ910418-0105,21,18,The release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure.
WSJ910418-0105,22,14,The urine portion of the test tells how much salt is in the bloodstream.
WSJ910418-0105,23,11,A high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure.
WSJ910418-0105,24,35,"The test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises, tending to boost blood pressure, the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt."
WSJ910418-0105,25,31,The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack.
WSJ910418-0105,26,11,The theory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost 20 years.
WSJ910418-0105,27,35,The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood.
WSJ910418-0105,28,13,"Such ""high renin"" people are at a high risk of a heart attack."
WSJ910418-0105,29,30,"On the other hand, in other patients with high blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood."
WSJ910418-0105,30,16,"These ""low renin"" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr. Laragh has maintained."
WSJ910418-0105,31,28,"In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure."
WSJ910418-0105,32,40,"The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions."
WSJ910418-0105,33,3,"In 1981, Dr."
WSJ910418-0105,34,15,Laragh's group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by Dr.
WSJ910418-0105,35,2,Alderman's team.
WSJ910418-0105,36,17,They kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks.
WSJ910418-0105,37,16,"The results, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, lend strong support to Dr."
WSJ910418-0105,38,2,Laragh's theory.
WSJ910418-0105,39,9,"Only 12% of the patients had high renin ""profiles""."
WSJ910418-0105,40,27,"But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation."
WSJ910418-0105,41,53,"The incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile -- 5.3 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years -- and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile, 3.3 per 1,000 person-years, Drs. Alderman, Laragh and their respective colleagues reported."
WSJ910418-0105,42,26,"Regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups, those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks."
WSJ910418-0105,43,30,"Smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers, but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles."
WSJ910418-0105,44,23,"""But the real dynamite is in the patients who didn't have any of the usual risk factors,"" Dr. Laragh said in an interview."
WSJ910418-0105,45,41,"Among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes, ""those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction {heart attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles,"" the researchers wrote."
WSJ910418-0105,46,23,There were no heart attacks among the 240 patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure.
WSJ910418-0105,47,25,"To Dr. Laragh, this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure."
WSJ910418-0105,48,15,"""We think everybody should have this simple and accurate test,"" he said in the interview."
WSJ910418-0105,49,7,"""It's a new window into heart disease""."
WSJ910418-0105,50,38,"In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is ""potentially useful"" in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack."
WSJ910418-0105,51,17,"But, he wrote, ""a larger, population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper""."
WSJ910418-0105,52,11,The experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
WSJ910418-0105,53,24,"Apparently by coincidence, Abbott Laboratories announced on Tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin."
WSJ910418-0105,54,13,Other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors.
WSJ910418-0105,55,12,The experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks.
WSJ910418-0105,56,41,"A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp.'s Capoten and Merck & Co.'s Vasotec, are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin."
WSJ910418-0105,57,23,Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure .

SJMN91-06234048,21,27,"""That would be going a bit far.""; A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political landscape."
SJMN91-06234048,22,37,"The thinking goes like this:; With his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other."
SJMN91-06234048,23,17,The coup falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he never enjoyed before.
SJMN91-06234048,24,30,"The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, ""The Moscow Club,"" foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis."
SJMN91-06234048,25,26,"Finder, who said he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks did not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest."
SJMN91-06234048,26,12,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone."
SJMN91-06234048,27,11,Speculation was not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.
SJMN91-06234048,28,40,"Theorizing was rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation, fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the Russian parliament building had no ammunition."
SJMN91-06234048,29,9,"Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the theory."
SJMN91-06234048,30,22,"The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility in a statement Monday."
SJMN91-06234048,31,36,"""It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they still needed him,"" said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies."

SJMN91-06235179,18,53,"In the aftermath of the coup, analysts also predicted that:; (check) Major constraints on Soviet cooperation with the West, such as the military's disaffection with Gorbachev's support of Bush's strategy during the Persian Gulf war, will now be greatly weakened or removed, although ""a benign"" Soviet Union cannot be assumed in every case."

SJMN91-06235187,13,14,"The ""coup people,"" as President Bush dubbed them, could not have miscalculated more profoundly."
SJMN91-06235187,14,26,"They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev, and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country."
SJMN91-06235187,15,32,"But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created."
SJMN91-06235187,16,18,"For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrats fell."
SJMN91-06235187,17,11,There will be much to sort out in the months ahead.
SJMN91-06235187,18,17,But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke.
SJMN91-06235187,19,21,"That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated."
SJMN91-06235187,20,10,Gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these events.
SJMN91-06235187,21,33,It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.
SJMN91-06235187,22,35,"Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him."
SJMN91-06235187,23,7,Yeltsin had two talents that Gorbachev lacked.
SJMN91-06235187,24,39,One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls.
SJMN91-06235187,25,24,"Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged."
SJMN91-06235187,26,8,Gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin.
SJMN91-06235187,27,31,"Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas."
SJMN91-06235187,28,45,"Gorbachev thought Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms."
SJMN91-06235187,29,8,"Instead, they turned out to be mortal enemies."
SJMN91-06235187,30,14,"If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have been undone by them."
SJMN91-06235187,31,51,"But when they closed the new, liberal news media and reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union -- a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom."
SJMN91-06235187,32,19,"For years, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible."
SJMN91-06235187,33,7,"Tuesday, it became clear that they were."
SJMN91-06235187,34,13,"Of course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for that."
SJMN91-06235187,35,23,He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.
SJMN91-06235187,36,40,"It is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their compatriots."
SJMN91-06235187,37,34,They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the Western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country.
SJMN91-06235187,38,20,"Even their own news media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup."
SJMN91-06235187,39,22,"By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest."
SJMN91-06235187,40,40,"As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of the Russian federation was a formidable political force."
SJMN91-06235187,41,22,"At first blush, the botching of the coup was surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and its allies run an efficient putsch?"
SJMN91-06235187,42,20,But these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case.
SJMN91-06235187,43,37,Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable -- that the Stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it .

SJMN91-06237020,11,35,"Yeltsin, the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week's military coup, has drastically tipped the balance of power here, showing himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev."
SJMN91-06237020,12,39,"In a symbol of the new order, the Russian tricolor, the banner of the anti-coup resistance, flew over the gates of the Kremlin alongside the red Soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the Bolshevik state."
SJMN91-06237020,13,49,"In a joint appearance with Gorbachev in the Russian parliament, broadcast live on Soviet television, Yeltsin made it clear that the Soviet president can maintain a semblance of authority only if he agrees to share power and intensify the march toward a democratic political system and a market economy."
SJMN91-06237020,14,12,"""And now for a bit of relaxation,"" Yeltsin said, interrupting Gorbachev's speech."
SJMN91-06237020,15,37,"""Let me sign a decree suspending the activity of the Russian Communist Party.""; Gorbachev, who has insisted the party is still capable of reform, stammered a bit and then said, ""Boris Nikolayevich, Boris Nikolayevich . . ""."
SJMN91-06237020,16,10,"With an expression that was half-smile, half-sneer, Yeltsin broke in."
SJMN91-06237020,17,15,"""It's been signed,"" he said definitively, and the deputies broke out in cheering and applause."
SJMN91-06237020,18,13,"Gorbachev struggled to explain his own position, but he seemed at a loss."
SJMN91-06237020,19,44,"Yeltsin, who clearly relished his emotional and political control of the parliament session, also played a critical role in selecting the new heads of the KGB, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry police, which until now have been bastions of opposition to reform."
SJMN91-06237020,20,21,"Flouting protocol, Yeltsin was the first to announce the appointments while speaking at a mass rally Friday morning outside KGB headquarters."
SJMN91-06237020,21,34,"New appointees; Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will head the KGB, Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the air force chief, becomes defense minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the union's interior minister."
SJMN91-06237020,22,24,All three men took a clear stand against the coup and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now head.
SJMN91-06237020,23,8,Gorbachev also fired Alexander Bessmertnykh as foreign minister.
SJMN91-06237020,24,89,"Although Bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders, Gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been ""maneuvering, or at least did not take a firm stand.""; Bessmertnykh reacted with ""bitterness,"" according to the Tass news agency, and claimed that he had refused to join the conservative uprising, even though coup leader and former KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov had told him, ""We need a liberal among us.""; In both Moscow and Leningrad, city officials ordered police to seal off Communist Party headquarters."
SJMN91-06237020,25,27,Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov said investigators had to make a thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the coup and its participants.
SJMN91-06237020,26,28,"Across the country, Communist Party leaders who opposed the coup quit their party posts, and some who supported it, such as Latvian party leader Alfred Rubiks, were arrested."
SJMN91-06237020,27,22,"The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II, said the coup meant the end of communist ideology in the country."
SJMN91-06237020,28,6,"""God has saved Russia,"" he declared."
SJMN91-06237020,29,52,"As Gorbachev struggled during the 90-minute session of the Russian parliament, he called for ""maturity and balance"" in judging the conspirators and said, ""Let's not have a witch hunt.""; Greeted by protesters; From the moment that protesters outside the Russian parliament building greeted the arrival of Gorbachev's limousine with shouts of ""Resign!"
SJMN91-06237020,30,26,"Resign""! it was clear that the Soviet president was not about to get a warm homecoming from those who played a key role in rescuing him."
SJMN91-06237020,31,13,The Russian deputies -- and Yeltsin especially -- were alternately sarcastic and aggressive.
SJMN91-06237020,32,20,"When Gorbachev had trouble at one point explaining one development in the coup, Yeltsin broke in like an exasperated schoolmaster."
SJMN91-06237020,33,7,"""Sometimes Mikhail Sergeyevich forgets things,"" he said."
SJMN91-06237020,34,22,Yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on Gorbachev just how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies.
SJMN91-06237020,35,50,He handed Gorbachev the minutes of a closed Council of Ministers meeting held last Monday during which all of the more than 20 ministers present -- with one or two exceptions -- supported the coup and the State Committee for the State of Emergency set up by the putsch leaders.
SJMN91-06237020,36,15,"""I haven't read this yet,"" said Gorbachev in an attempt to put off the matter."
SJMN91-06237020,37,4,"""Go ahead,"" Yeltsin insisted."
SJMN91-06237020,38,32,"""Read it now.""; And Gorbachev did, reeling off the names of all of the ministers who had for so long mouthed the slogans of reform and then stabbed him in the back."
SJMN91-06237020,39,17,"""This whole government has got to resign,"" Gorbachev said with a degree of despair in his voice."
SJMN91-06237020,40,31,"""I must say this has been a great drama for me, a severe trial.""; Retribution for Yeltsin; Yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this Shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution."
SJMN91-06237020,41,25,It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party Committee.
SJMN91-06237020,42,24,"At that session, one speaker after another attacked Yeltsin for ""political immaturity"" and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its Politburo."
SJMN91-06237020,43,23,And it was Gorbachev in 1990 who came to the Russian parliament to call on deputies to vote against Yeltsin as their chairman.
SJMN91-06237020,44,49,"Although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of Soviet politics."
SJMN91-06237020,45,16,Gorbachev said he and Yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an emergency.
SJMN91-06237020,46,30,"""If one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders, like what happened now, his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other,"" Gorbachev said."
SJMN91-06237020,47,19,It appeared that the move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with legislative consent.
SJMN91-06237020,48,8,Soviet law makes the vice president the next-in-line.
SJMN91-06237020,49,13,Gennady Yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring Gorbachev physically incapacitated.
SJMN91-06237020,50,10,The conspirators themselves are now in jail and facing interrogation.
SJMN91-06237020,51,44,"Gorbachev said the leaders of the junta ""tried to turn us all into chopped meat"" and they should be prosecuted without ""hesitation or forgiveness.""; Soviet Prime Minister Valetin Pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup, Soviet and Russian television reported today."
SJMN91-06237020,52,28,"Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev from power, but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup began."
SJMN91-06237020,53,14,He has been under police guard in a hospital since Gorbachev regained power Wednesday.
SJMN91-06237020,54,14,Speculation of guilt also turned on another key figure in the old Gorbachev government.
SJMN91-06237020,55,24,"According to Yeltsin, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup, but that has not been confirmed ."

SJMN91-06238185,12,13,Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power.
SJMN91-06238185,13,15,"Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup."
SJMN91-06238185,14,10,"But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves."
SJMN91-06238185,15,43,"A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the ""nightingale of the General Staff,"" published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov."
SJMN91-06238185,16,26,"With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union."
SJMN91-06238185,17,14,"Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight."
SJMN91-06238185,18,4,Gorbachev ignored these warnings.
SJMN91-06238185,19,28,To some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka.
SJMN91-06238185,20,26,"And to laymen, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power."
SJMN91-06238185,21,31,"The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the Crimea."
SJMN91-06238185,22,29,"Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup?"
SJMN91-06238185,23,15,"Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?"
SJMN91-06238185,24,40,"If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?"
SJMN91-06238185,25,28,It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing.
SJMN91-06238185,26,16,Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.
SJMN91-06238185,27,60,"A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics."
SJMN91-06238185,28,42,"It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence."
SJMN91-06238185,29,19,"Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup."
SJMN91-06238185,30,34,"One was head of the KGB department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other was V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him."
SJMN91-06238185,31,43,"One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise."
SJMN91-06238185,32,36,"Conspiracy theorists grope for motives -- Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers."
SJMN91-06238185,33,9,But there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point.
SJMN91-06238185,34,23,Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him .

AP890922-0007,13,28,Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
AP890922-0007,14,38,"``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston, where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode."
AP890922-0007,15,28,"``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city."
AP890922-0007,16,15,``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life''.
AP890922-0007,17,9,"By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston."
AP890922-0007,18,25,"The roof cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber."
AP890922-0007,19,11,Phone and electric service to the command post was knocked out.
AP890922-0007,20,43,"Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla."
AP890922-0007,21,34,"The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135 mph. Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast."
AP890922-0007,22,27,"The storm posed a 19 percent chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said."
AP890922-0007,23,25,"As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach, 200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort towns themselves."
AP890922-0007,24,13,Power lines and trees were downed in some spots and water flooded roads.
AP890922-0007,25,11,Stop lights and neon lights were knocked out in Myrtle Beach.
AP890922-0007,26,19,"``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach."
AP890922-0007,27,15,"In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs, palmetto fronds and chunks of bark."
AP890922-0007,28,11,Businesses were closed and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
AP890922-0007,29,8,Riley ordered residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
AP890922-0007,30,24,"Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients, officials said."
AP890922-0007,31,36,"About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220 miles northwest of here."
AP890922-0007,32,29,"``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach."
AP890922-0007,33,14,"``We tried to post guards at the doors, but people were still coming in''."
AP890922-0007,34,24,"American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who appealed for help."
AP890922-0007,35,17,``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of people all along the Eastern seaboard.
AP890922-0007,36,21,"This of course is at the same time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the other Caribbean islands."
AP890922-0007,37,6,``We're beginning to feel the squeeze.
AP890922-0007,38,5,Our resources are very tight.
AP890922-0007,39,17,Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade''.
AP890922-0007,40,19,"At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said."
AP890922-0007,41,13,The hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
AP890922-0007,42,24,"Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from 125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before."
AP890922-0007,43,20,"North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center."
AP890922-0007,44,20,"The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said."
AP890922-0007,45,14,"A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C."
AP890922-0007,46,28,"By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category, which indicated it could cause extreme damage."
AP890922-0007,47,23,"``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians."
AP890922-0007,48,35,"The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m."
AP890922-0007,49,24,"``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean off.''"

AP890922-0049,11,28,"This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo."
AP890922-0049,12,14,"The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night."
AP890922-0049,13,49,"``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959."
AP890922-0049,14,12,"The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both natural and man-made."
AP890922-0049,15,29,"The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage."
AP890922-0049,16,20,"Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861."
AP890922-0049,17,27,"The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians of refinement as ``September gales''."
AP890922-0049,18,33,"But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day."
AP890922-0049,19,15,The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago and New York City.
AP890922-0049,20,30,"Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets."
AP890922-0049,21,23,"In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches."
AP890922-0049,22,17,"Charleston has received international acclaim as home to Spoleto Festival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti."
AP890922-0049,23,14,Organizers like to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive arts festival .
AP890922-0119,10,23,"While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city."
AP890922-0119,11,33,"Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil War began."
AP890922-0119,12,11,"Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston."
AP890922-0119,13,28,"But the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years."
AP890922-0119,14,22,"From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike the Southeast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, their number was up."
AP890922-0119,15,19,"As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office."
AP890922-0119,16,14,On his desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss of power.
AP890922-0119,17,29,Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City Council chamber.
AP890922-0119,18,12,Phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked out.
AP890922-0119,19,13,"During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the National Weather Service."
AP890922-0119,20,24,"As the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the damage."
AP890922-0119,21,27,"The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, was unsettling: The tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles were scattered on the ground."
AP890922-0119,22,7,"Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the street."
AP890922-0119,23,7,``This is the eye of the hurricane.
AP890922-0119,24,15,"I've never been in one and I hope I'm never in one again,'' Riley said."
AP890922-0119,25,6,``It's scarcely a late summer breeze''.
AP890922-0119,26,27,"As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage."
AP890922-0119,27,7,"``Serious but fixable,'' the mayor concluded ."
AP890922-0167,10,28,"Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast."
AP890922-0167,11,7,But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
AP890922-0167,12,16,"Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C."
AP890922-0167,13,30,"``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service."
AP890922-0167,14,22,"Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation."
AP890922-0167,15,32,"``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner,'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie."
AP890922-0167,16,28,"The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston."
AP890922-0167,17,21,"``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said."
AP890922-0167,18,11,``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength''.
AP890922-0167,19,21,"The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance."
AP890922-0167,20,28,"Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships."
AP890922-0167,21,18,"``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said."
AP890922-0167,22,16,"In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture."
AP890922-0167,23,20,Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
AP890922-0167,24,39,"Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane."
AP890922-0167,25,26,"To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane."
AP890922-0167,26,9,Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
AP890922-0167,27,16,Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
AP890922-0167,28,27,"``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said."
AP890922-0167,29,22,"Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path."
AP890922-0167,30,25,"``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,'' Emmanuel said."
AP890922-0167,31,18,Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
AP890922-0167,32,28,"``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.''"
AP890925-0054,10,32,"Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said."
AP890925-0054,11,30,"The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds."
AP890925-0054,12,13,"``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr."
AP890925-0054,13,26,``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death''.
AP890925-0054,14,19,"Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings."
AP890925-0054,15,21,"The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida."
AP890925-0054,16,20,"Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings."
AP890925-0054,17,16,"``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service."
AP890925-0054,18,9,"``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said."
AP890925-0054,19,5,``This time they realized it''.
AP890925-0054,20,20,"Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters."
AP890925-0054,21,15,Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
AP890925-0054,22,19,"Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings."
AP890925-0054,23,13,"``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said."
AP890925-0054,24,10,``You've just got to say nice things about the people''.
AP890925-0054,25,20,"Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing."
AP890925-0054,26,10,"``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said ."
AP890928-0099,8,22,"It's taken the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart."
AP890928-0099,9,19,"As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover."
AP890928-0099,10,28,"After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October 1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letter from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston."
AP890928-0099,11,16,"The letter included nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through their crisis."
AP890928-0099,12,41,"``This money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want,'' Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778."
AP890928-0099,13,15,Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week.
AP890928-0099,14,13,"``I figured they helped us, we should do something for them,'' Ford said."
AP890928-0099,15,15,"On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collecting donations for victims of the hurricane."
AP890928-0099,16,27,"``A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations down there,'' said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the Ulster County Chapter of the Red Cross."
AP890928-0099,17,22,"On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food, clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo."
AP890928-0099,18,23,A New York National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick up equipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.

LA092189-0225,17,3,Tidal Surge Feared
LA092189-0225,18,35,"The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot tide that peaks after 2 a.m ."

LA092789-0093,9,27,The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
LA092789-0093,10,18,Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry .
LA092789-0093,11,27,"State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said."
LA092789-0093,12,24,"The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said ."
LA092789-0093,13,39,"Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985 ."
LA092789-0093,14,23,"""Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston."
LA092789-0093,15,23,"There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage"" as in Hugo, Parsons said."
LA092789-0093,16,34,"Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C ."
LA092789-0093,17,4,Losses Still Being Tallied
LA092789-0093,18,28,"Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina."
LA092789-0093,19,12,"""We have so far received 16,000 claims,"" spokesman Bob Sohozich said ."
LA092789-0093,20,44,"Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said ."
LA092789-0093,21,17,The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.
LA092789-0093,22,29,"Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs."
LA092789-0093,23,26,"For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages."
LA092789-0093,24,32,Reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies .
LA092789-0093,25,38,"Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies ."
LA092789-0093,26,26,"Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm."
LA092789-0093,27,22,"The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force ."
LA092789-0093,28,4,Forecasts May Be Cut
LA092789-0093,29,23,"The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York."
LA092789-0093,30,14,"""If there is a profit, it will be a very small one,"" he said."
LA092789-0093,31,14,"The charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25%, he added ."
LA092789-0093,32,37,"Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for Cigna Corp., USF&G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings ."
LA092789-0093,33,22,"Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest."
LA092789-0093,34,27,"But ""this could be a positive for the industry,"" Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized."
LA092789-0093,35,30,"Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have ""a significant impact on excess capital,"" he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly ."
LA092789-0093,36,12,"""That would be good for the companies and shareholders,"" he said ."

WSJ890927-0018,9,33,"Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say."
WSJ890927-0018,10,25,"The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow."
WSJ890927-0018,11,30,"""Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record,"" said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979."
WSJ890927-0018,12,28,"The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos."
WSJ890927-0018,13,23,Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future.
WSJ890927-0018,14,22,"In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds."
WSJ890927-0018,15,21,"And since Hugo also stormed through the Caribbean, foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands."
WSJ890927-0018,16,33,"Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months."
WSJ890927-0018,17,7,Rates have been falling since late 1986.
WSJ890927-0018,18,18,Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990.
WSJ890927-0018,19,39,"For the time being, the losses from Hugo ""will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle,"" said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James & Co., a New York-based insurance broker."
WSJ890927-0018,20,25,"For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses."
WSJ890927-0018,21,25,"Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo ""is the single largest claims disaster"" it has seen in its 63-year history."
WSJ890927-0018,22,28,"The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region."
WSJ890927-0018,23,8,"Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said."
WSJ890927-0018,24,7,"For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy."
WSJ890927-0018,25,42,"New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane."
WSJ890927-0018,26,10,"""Hugo will be particularly costly to us,"" said John P."
WSJ890927-0018,27,3,"Mascotte, Continental's chairman."
WSJ890927-0018,28,41,"Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said."
WSJ890927-0018,29,17,Some of USF&G's losses hit very close home -- its Charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane.
WSJ890927-0018,30,36,"Both USF&G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses."
WSJ890927-0018,31,25,"Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analysts."
WSJ890927-0018,32,43,"Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ""financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends,"" to compel them to boost premium rates right away."
WSJ890927-0018,33,33,"He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity."
WSJ890927-0018,34,19,"He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful."
WSJ890927-0018,35,13,"Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus."
WSJ890927-0018,36,9,"Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said."
WSJ890927-0018,37,21,An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes.
WSJ890927-0018,38,23,Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses.
WSJ890927-0018,39,19,"Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said losses from Hugo could be big enough to ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rates."
WSJ890927-0018,40,19,"Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results."
WSJ890927-0018,41,43,"Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane."
WSJ890927-0018,42,10,"State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance."
WSJ890927-0018,43,15,"It believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said ."
WSJ890928-0084,9,21,"Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers."
WSJ890928-0084,10,22,New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
WSJ890928-0084,11,29,Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
WSJ890928-0084,12,17,"AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas."
WSJ890928-0084,13,18,"St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million."
WSJ890928-0084,14,18,"That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said."
WSJ890928-0084,15,15,Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
WSJ890928-0084,16,35,"Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis."
WSJ890928-0084,17,16,That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
WSJ890928-0084,18,37,"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster."
WSJ890928-0084,19,18,"When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million."
WSJ890928-0084,20,27,"It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983 ."
