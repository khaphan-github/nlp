AP880314-0110,"The communist world gets its first McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica. The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade's main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the other specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West. The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica."
AP880324-0193,"Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches. ``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac. People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West."

The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner."
AP880512-0096,"A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media. But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that topic is still too sensitive. In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me''."
AP880512-0157,"Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife. This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union. The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media."
AP880521-0088,"Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.

AP880711-0056,"The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today. The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which was already below the expected production."
AP880711-0221,"The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday. But the United States ``will continue to be a major player'' in world agriculture and in 1989 ``should be able to bounce back'' from this year's drought losses, he said. Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors."
AP880712-0250,"Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend. Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in the lower Mississippi River.

He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers."

AP880816-0135,"More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said. The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw, comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation.

Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said. Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said."

AP880819-0023,"Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight. Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket. Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration."

A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half. The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them."

AP880916-0060,"Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters. ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. ``It doesn't happen very often."
AP880917-0095,"Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border. At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.

Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.

AP881114-0006,"Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say. Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies. Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel."

AP881115-0113,"The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday. The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty. Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available."

Riley Jr."
AP890925-0124,"Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are ``monsters'' who will be found and punished. ``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time,'' she said following a tour of the school's wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England. ``We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic views,'' she said."

Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area. The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P. Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return of the support his city got after Hugo."

A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979 . Here's a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred Britain:"

WSJ890922-0113,"The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys. No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification. Proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of East Bloc reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to Washington and Moscow."
WSJ890927-0018,"Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say. The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow. ""Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record,"" said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979."
WSJ890928-0084,"Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages."
WSJ891019-0021,"The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly. In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning. Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action."
WSJ891019-0086,"Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake. Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month. The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division."
WSJ900803-0023,"Administration and congressional officials agree that the CIA did its job. Since last week, President Bush had been warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even Saudi Arabia. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft."

And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April 15. Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr."
WSJ910418-0105,"The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attacks. About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure. It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks."
